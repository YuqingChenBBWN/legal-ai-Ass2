**Canvassian Pty Ltd Board Paper**

**Date:** October 10, 2023

**Subject:** Corporate Risk Assessment: Customer Dissatisfaction and Mitigation Strategies

**Prepared by:** Rachel Johnson, Chief Risk Officer

**Executive Summary:**
This board paper aims to address the escalating risk of customer dissatisfaction that Canvassian Pty Ltd is currently facing. Specifically, it examines the causes of this dissatisfaction, its potential impacts on our company, and proposes a set of strategic initiatives to mitigate the risks associated with this issue.

**1. Introduction:**
Customer satisfaction has always been a cornerstone of Canvassian’s success. However, recent feedback from both major and minor clients suggests an increasing trend in customer dissatisfaction, which poses a significant risk to our company’s reputation and financial stability.

**2. Causes of Customer Dissatisfaction:**
a. **Product Performance Issues:**
   Recent updates and product launches have been plagued with bugs and performance issues. In particular, the AlphaLaunch module has received significant criticism for its instability.

b. **Customer Service Delays:**
   The Customer Service department has seen increased response times due to higher call volumes and understaffing, leading to unresolved customer issues.

c. **Market Competition:**
   Emerging competitors offer similar software solutions at competitive pricing, enhancing features that our current offerings do not match.

**3. Impact Analysis:**
a. **Client Retention:**
   Dissatisfaction may lead to the loss of key clients. Our five major clients, Paywise, Alphabear, Bravocat, Charlemont, Deltaforce, and Echona, contribute to 70% of our revenue. Losing any of them would have dire financial consequences.

b. **Brand Reputation:**
   Negative feedback can tarnish our market reputation, affecting our ability to attract new clients and talented employees.

c. **Employee Morale:**
   Continuous customer complaints can demoralize our employees, affecting productivity and increasing turnover rates.

**4. Mitigation Strategies:**
To address and mitigate the risks associated with customer dissatisfaction, we propose the following strategies:

a. **Product Enhancement:**
   - Form a dedicated task force led by CTO Edon Mask to quickly address and resolve technical issues in AlphaLaunch.
   - Implement a rigorous pre-launch testing protocol for all future product releases to ensure stability and performance.

b. **Customer Service Optimization:**
   - Increase the Customer Service team’s headcount by 20% over the next quarter to handle higher call volumes efficiently.
   - Introduce advanced CRM software to optimize case handling and reduce response times.

c. **Market Competitiveness:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive market analysis to identify key areas where we lag behind competitors. Use these insights to inform our R&D investments.
   - Offer promotional pricing and enhanced feature packages to retain at-risk clients.

d. **Employee Engagement:**
   - Initiate regular training programs to upskill existing employees, particularly in customer-facing roles.
   - Create an internal feedback loop where employees can suggest improvements, fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

**5. Conclusion:**
Addressing customer dissatisfaction is critical for maintaining Canvassian’s position as a market leader. The proposed strategies aim to resolve immediate issues and lay the groundwork for long-term customer satisfaction and loyalty. By taking prompt and decisive action, we can mitigate risks and secure our company’s future.

**6. Recommendations:**
- Approve an emergency fund of $500,000 to implement technical fixes and customer service enhancements.
- Establish a quarterly review process to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies and make necessary adjustments.
- Form a cross-functional team under the CEO’s leadership to continuously monitor client feedback and market trends.

**Board Approval:**
This board paper requires the approval of the Board of Directors to initiate the outlined strategies.
