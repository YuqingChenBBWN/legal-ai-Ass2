**1. Executive Summary**

This board paper addresses two significant corporate risks currently facing Canvassian Pty Ltd: the potential fallout from a poor product launch and rising customer dissatisfaction. This paper outlines the causes, potential impacts, and proposed mitigation measures for these risks.

**2. Background**

Canvassian has historically been a leader in software innovation, boasting a successful track record with numerous product launches. However, recent feedback and pre-launch data for our upcoming software, CanvassPro 2.0, indicate potential issues that could undermine its success. Concurrently, dissatisfaction among both major and minor clients has seen an uptick according to recent customer satisfaction surveys.

**3. Detailed Analysis**

**3.1 Risk 1: Poor Product Launch**

**a. Cause:**
- **Technical Issues:** Persistent bugs identified during beta testing.
- **Market Mismatch:** CanvassPro 2.0 features may not fully align with current market needs based on competitor analysis and feedback from early adopters.

**b. Potential Impact:**
- **Reputation Damage:** A subpar product launch could tarnish Canvassian's market reputation and decrease investor confidence.
- **Revenue Loss:** Failure to meet sales projections could significantly impact our revenue, especially considering the R&D investment in CanvassPro 2.0.
- **Client Turnover:** Major clients, notably Paywise and Alphabear, have expressed concern over the product’s readiness.

**3.2 Risk 2: Customer Dissatisfaction**

**a. Cause:**
- **Support Issues:** Delayed response times and inadequate problem resolution have been frequently cited.
- **Product Performance:** Existing software solutions have shown intermittent performance issues.

**b. Potential Impact:**
- **Churn Rate:** Increased dissatisfaction could lead to a higher churn rate, particularly among our minor clients, causing a gradual revenue loss.
- **Brand Loyalty:** Ongoing dissatisfaction may erode brand loyalty, making it harder to secure renewals and upsell opportunities with our major clients.
- **Market Position:** As negative reviews accumulate, our position as a preferred software solutions provider could be undermined.

**4.1 Addressing the Product Launch Risk:**

**a. Strengthened QA Processes:**

**b. Improved Communication:**
- **Transparency:** Communicate openly with our clients and stakeholders about the revised launch timeline and the steps we are taking to ensure product quality.

**4.2 Addressing the Customer Dissatisfaction Risk:**

**a. Customer Support Overhaul:**

**b. Product Performance Enhancement:**
