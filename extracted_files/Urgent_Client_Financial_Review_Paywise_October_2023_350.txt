Dear James,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to draw your attention to a concerning development regarding our client, Paywise. Recent financial statements indicate that they may be experiencing significant financial distress. Their latest quarterly reports showed a substantial decline in revenue, and preliminary conversations with their finance team suggest they are struggling with cash flow issues.

Given the importance of Paywise as one of our major clients, it's critical that we act swiftly to assess the potential implications for our partnership. I recommend we schedule a meeting with our Account Management team to evaluate our current engagement with Paywise and identify any immediate support we can offer them.

Additionally, we should prepare for a review of their contract terms in light of these developments. Engaging in an open dialogue with their leadership will be crucial to maintaining our relationship and mitigating any risks.

Please let me know your availability this week for a meeting, and I'll coordinate with the others to ensure everyone can join.

Best regards,

Samantha Greene
