Subject: Proposal for Enhancing Client Engagement Strategies

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to discuss our upcoming strategy meeting scheduled for next week. As we prepare our agenda, I believe itâ€™s important for us to consider enhancements to our client engagement strategies. 

I recently attended a conference where I heard several innovative approaches that could be beneficial for Canvassian, especially under Jane Wu's leadership as we strive to further strengthen our relationships with our key clients. Our team has the talent and creativity to explore new avenues for engagement that could lead to significant growth.

Please come prepared with your thoughts and any additional ideas you might have. I look forward to collaborating with each of you.

Best regards,

Michelle Turner  
Senior Product Manager
