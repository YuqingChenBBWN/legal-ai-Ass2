Dear Eliza,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention some emerging corporate risks regarding our engagement with Deltaforce. Given their recent shift in leadership and a notable restructuring strategy, there are concerns about their long-term operational stability. 

As you know, Deltaforce has historically been one of our major clients, and they contribute significantly to our revenue. However, recent reports indicate that their new executive team is evaluating potential cuts to external partnerships, which naturally raises concerns regarding our ongoing projects.

I recommend that we initiate a more comprehensive risk assessment as soon as possible to evaluate potential implications for our business. Additionally, it might be prudent to schedule a meeting with Richard Bennett, our account manager for Deltaforce, to understand any feedback he has received from their team.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Best regards,

David Mandell
