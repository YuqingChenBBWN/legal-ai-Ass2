Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our current project timeframe, especially in light of Jane's recent feedback during the last executive meeting. It's vital that we maintain our momentum as she expressed a strong interest in seeing our progress at the upcoming board presentation.

Could you provide me with an update on the milestones achieved so far? Additionally, if there are any roadblocks that need addressing, please let me know so we can strategize effectively.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,  
Mark Thompson
