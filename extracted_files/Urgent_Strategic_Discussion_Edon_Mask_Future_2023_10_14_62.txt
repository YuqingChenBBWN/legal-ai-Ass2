Dear Michael,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to reach out to discuss a sensitive matter that has come to my attention regarding Edon Mask, our CTO. There have been whispers about Edon considering new opportunities outside of Canvassian. Given his critical role in our technological vision and product development, it is essential that we address this proactively.

As you know, Edon has been integral in shaping our technology strategy, and his departure could have significant implications for our projects and overall direction. I believe it would be prudent for us to set up a meeting with Jane to discuss how we can engage with Edon and understand his intentions. It is vital that we create an environment conducive to his continued contributions while simultaneously ensuring our team remains aligned and motivated.

Could you please coordinate with Jane and suggest a time for us to meet this week? We need to be prepared to address this situation head-on and strategize accordingly.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
