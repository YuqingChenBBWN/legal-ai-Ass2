Hi John,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the timeline for the Canvassian Project. After our recent discussions with the development team, we have adjusted the completion dates as follows:

- **Phase 1:** Completion by March 15, 2024
- **Phase 2:** Completion by June 30, 2024
- **Phase 3:** Final project delivery by September 15, 2024

If you could please ensure that your team is aligned with these new timelines, it would be greatly appreciated. We want to maintain our momentum and ensure that all stakeholders are on the same page.

Let me know if you have any concerns or if we need to schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss this further.

Best regards,

Sarah Mitchell
