Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well!

I wanted to follow up on our discussion from last week regarding the new project initiatives. The team has made great progress, and I believe we are on track for the deliverables scheduled next quarter. 

Additionally, I had a productive meeting with our client, Paywise, and they expressed great enthusiasm about our proposed rollout. This feedback could be instrumental in refining our strategies moving forward. 

Let me know when you would be available for a quick catch-up to discuss our next steps.

Best regards,
