Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the project collaboration between Canvassian and Alphabear.

As we move forward, it's crucial for us to finalize the project timelines and deliverables. I believe that with our teams working together, we can achieve great results and create value for both organizations.

Could you please confirm your availability for a meeting next week? I suggest we meet on Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon, but I'm open to any time that works best for you and your team.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Sarah Johnson
