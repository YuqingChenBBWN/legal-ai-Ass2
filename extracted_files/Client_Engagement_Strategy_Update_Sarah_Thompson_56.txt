Subject: Update on Client Engagement Strategy

From: Sarah Thompson, Senior Account Manager  
To: Jason Lee, Sales Director  

Dear Jason,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide an update on our ongoing client engagement strategy, particularly focused on our major clients: Paywise, Alphabear, Bravocat, Charlemont, Deltaforce, and Echona.

As we aim to strengthen our relationships with these key accounts, I suggest scheduling a meeting with the product management team to discuss any updates or features that could be of significant interest to our clients. Additionally, it would be beneficial to gather feedback from our sales team on recent interactions to identify any potential areas for improvement.

Could you please let me know your availability for the upcoming week? It would be great to finalize the details so we can set a date for the meeting.

Thank you, and I look forward to your input.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
