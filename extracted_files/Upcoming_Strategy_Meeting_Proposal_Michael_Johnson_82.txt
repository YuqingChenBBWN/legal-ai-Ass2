Dear Lisa,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’d like to propose a meeting to discuss our upcoming product launch strategy and marketing initiatives. With the recent feedback from our major clients—especially Paywise and Bravocat—it’s crucial that we align our efforts to maximize impact.

Could you please let me know your availability for next week? I believe it would be beneficial to have Edon and Jane in attendance, as their insights will be invaluable for the discussions.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Michael Johnson
