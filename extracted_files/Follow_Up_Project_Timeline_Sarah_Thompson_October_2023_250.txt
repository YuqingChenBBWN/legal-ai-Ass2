Hi Liam,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the project timelines for the upcoming releases. It's essential that we remain on track, especially with the deadlines for our key clients approaching.

I had a conversation with the team handling our Bravocat account, and they have mentioned that they would appreciate any updates we can provide them regarding the features we are incorporating. It might be worth coordinating a check-in next week to ensure we are aligned and can address any concerns they might have.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting and if there's anything specific you would like to discuss.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
