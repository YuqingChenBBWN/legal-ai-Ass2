Dear Robert,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to provide you with an update on the ongoing project between Canvassian and Paywise. We have made significant progress in the integration phase, and our team has successfully completed the preliminary development work. As a result, we are on track to meet our initial timeline.

In the coming week, we will schedule a meeting to discuss the next steps, including key deliverables and milestones as we move forward. Please let me know your availability, and I will coordinate with the team accordingly.

Thank you for your continued partnership, and we look forward to achieving great results together.

Best regards,
