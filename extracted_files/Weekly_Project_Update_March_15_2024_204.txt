Hi Mark,

I hope this email finds you well. As we continue to make progress on the upcoming project deliverables, I wanted to share a brief overview of our current status.

The team has completed the initial phases of the project, and we are on track for the next milestones. I had a productive call with our key client, Paywise, regarding their latest requirements, and they are excited about the progress we’re making. There are a few additional points they would like us to address, and I’m coordinating with the product managers to ensure we are aligned.

Let me know if you need any specifics on other clients or projects during our next catch-up. 

Thanks,  
Sarah
