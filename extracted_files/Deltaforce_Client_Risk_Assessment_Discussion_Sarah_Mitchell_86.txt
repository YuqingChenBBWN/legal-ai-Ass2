Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention a corporate risk we've identified in relation to our client, Deltaforce. As you are aware, Deltaforce has been a key component of our revenue stream, but recent market shifts and their restructuring may pose potential implications for our ongoing projects.

During our latest risk assessment meeting, we highlighted several concerns:
1. **Financial Stability**: Deltaforce's recent layoffs and restructuring efforts could affect their financial stability, impacting their ability to honor contracts and commitments with us.
2. **Project Delays**: With the current changes within their organization, we need to evaluate how this may delay ongoing projects and result in potential claims for delays.
3. **Client Communication**: We should enhance communication with Deltaforce to ensure we are aligned on expectations and that we proactively address any upcoming disruptions.

I believe it would be prudent for us to meet and discuss our strategy on mitigating these risks further, as well as any additional support Deltaforce might need from our team during this transitional period.

Can we schedule a time early next week to go over this?

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best,
