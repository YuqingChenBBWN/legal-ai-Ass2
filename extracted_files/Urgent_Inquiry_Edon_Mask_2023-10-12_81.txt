Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your immediate attention some recent developments that have surfaced regarding Edon. There have been whispers within our internal circles suggesting that he may be facing an inquiry related to some corporate practices that were not properly aligned with our compliance protocols.

I understand how sensitive this issue can be, and I urge you to keep this information confidential for the time being. The integrity of our company and the well-being of our team must remain our top priority as we navigate this situation. 

Additionally, I believe it might be prudent for us to convene a small meeting with Jane and Rachel to discuss our course of action, should this investigation materialize. We need to ensure that we are prepared and have measures in place to protect the interests of Canvassian and our employees.

Thanks for handling this with discretion, and please let me know your availability for a quick chat.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson  
HR Manager
