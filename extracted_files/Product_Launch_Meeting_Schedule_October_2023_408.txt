Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming product launch, I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss our final strategy and timelines. 

I propose we meet on Wednesday, October 11th at 10:00 AM. Please let me know if this works for you or if there is a more convenient time.

Additionally, I'll prepare the latest sales figures and customer feedback for our review. It will be crucial to understand how we can tailor our marketing efforts before the launch.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
