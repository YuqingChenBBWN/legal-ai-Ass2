Subject: Upcoming Product Launch Strategy Meeting

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming launch of our new software product, I would like to schedule a strategy meeting to discuss our marketing approach, sales targets, and support plans.

Please let me know your availability for next week. I will circulate a calendar invite once we finalize a time that works for everyone. Additionally, please come prepared with any ideas or suggestions you may have, as your insights will be invaluable to the planning process.

Looking forward to collaborating with all of you on this exciting initiative!

Best regards,
