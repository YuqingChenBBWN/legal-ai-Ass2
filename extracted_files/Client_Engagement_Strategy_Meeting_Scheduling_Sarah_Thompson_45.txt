Dear Alex,

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss our upcoming client engagement strategy for the next quarter. Given the importance of maintaining strong relationships with both our major and minor clients, itâ€™s crucial that we align our efforts and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Please let me know your availability this week, and I can coordinate with the team to find a suitable time for everyone involved. Also, I would encourage you to gather any insights or suggestions you may have regarding our current strategies so that we can address them during our discussion.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
