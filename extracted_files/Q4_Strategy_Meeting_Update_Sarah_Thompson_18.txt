Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well. 

As we approach the end of Q3, I wanted to remind you about the upcoming Q4 strategy meeting scheduled for next Friday, October 13, at 10:00 AM in the main conference room. Itâ€™s crucial that the product and tech teams align with marketing on our new initiatives, especially the rollout for the upcoming features that are slated for launch at the beginning of next quarter.

Please prepare any updates you have regarding the integration of user feedback into the development roadmap and any projected timelines for the upcoming releases. 

Your insights on how we can better support the technology and product development would be greatly appreciated. Also, it would be beneficial for us to discuss potential collaborative efforts with our major clients, particularly Paywise and Alphabear.

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
