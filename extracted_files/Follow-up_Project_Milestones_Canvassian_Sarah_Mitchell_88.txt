Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the upcoming milestones for the Canvassian software development project.

As we approach the end of Q3, I believe it’s crucial for us to have a clear understanding of our expectations and next steps. As of today, we have completed the initial phases of development and are preparing for the integration testing scheduled for next month.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to go over the project timeline and address any potential roadblocks? I will also prepare a status report highlighting the progress and areas that may need your attention.

Please let me know your available times, and I’ll coordinate with the rest of the team.

Thank you!

Best regards,

Sarah Mitchell
