Subject: Update on Product Releases and Client Engagement

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to take a moment to share some updates regarding our upcoming product releases, which I believe will enhance our offerings and strengthen our relationships with clients, particularly Paywise, who has shown great interest in our next features.

The engineering team is finalizing the latest updates and we are on track for our beta testing next week. I encourage everyone to engage with the client management teams, as gathering feedback from our major clients will be invaluable. 

Additionally, letâ€™s ensure our marketing materials highlight the advanced capabilities that our new products will bring. This can certainly be an opportunity to present our solutions to other clients as well.

If anyone has any questions or needs assistance in connecting with our clients, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your continued hard work!

Best regards,

Tom Harris
