Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our upcoming product launch strategy meeting scheduled for next week. As we finalize our presentation materials, I believe it would be beneficial to incorporate key insights from Jane Wu's recent address at the tech conference. Her emphasis on innovation and client engagement aligns perfectly with our objectives for this launch.

Could we set aside some time before the meeting to ensure that our slides reflect her vision? I think this would resonate well with the board and stakeholders.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Sarah Adams
