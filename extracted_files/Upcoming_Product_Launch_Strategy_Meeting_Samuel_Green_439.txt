Dear Emily,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the launch of our new software solution, I would like to schedule a strategy meeting to discuss the marketing plan and rollout schedule. Itâ€™s crucial that we align our efforts to ensure a successful launch.

Could you please provide your availability for a meeting next week? I suggest that we aim for a 1-hour session, where we can outline key marketing messages and the promotional activities aligned with the launch. Additionally, it would be beneficial to review any feedback we've gathered from our major clients, including Paywise and Alphabear.

Let me know what time works best for you and if there are any specific topics you would like to add to the agenda.

Thank you!

Best regards,  
Samuel Green
