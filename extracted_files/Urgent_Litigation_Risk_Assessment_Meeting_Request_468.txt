Subject: Urgent: Litigation Risk Assessment Required

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we move forward with our plans for the next quarter, I want to bring to your attention a critical issue that has arisen regarding potential litigation risks we may be facing.

Our legal team has informed us that we are currently under regulatory scrutiny concerning our software’s data privacy policies. This investigation could have significant implications on our ongoing projects with clients, including Paywise and Bravocat. As you know, maintaining strict compliance is vital, not only to safeguard our reputation but also to mitigate any financial impacts that may arise from potential fines or sanctions.

I would like us to convene a meeting to discuss this matter further and to assess the necessary steps for compliance and risk management. It’s crucial to strategize on communicating this effectively to our clients, particularly those in highly regulated industries, to maintain their trust and confidence in Canvassian.

Please share your availability for a meeting this week so that we can address these concerns promptly.

Best regards,

Michael Garcia
