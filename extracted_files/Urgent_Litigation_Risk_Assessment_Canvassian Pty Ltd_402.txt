Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your immediate attention a potential litigation risk that has surfaced concerning our relationship with one of our major clients, Bravocat. It has come to my notice that they have initiated a preliminary investigation related to allegations of a defective product delivered within the last quarter. Although we have yet to receive a formal complaint, Bravocat has expressed concerns regarding functionality issues that might expose us to reputational risk and possible financial liability.

I recommend we conduct a comprehensive review of all product documentation and communication with Bravocat over the past six months. This will allow us to assess our position and prepare an appropriate response in the event that formal legal action is taken against us.

Furthermore, I suggest scheduling a meeting early next week with the product management team to discuss our strategy and ensure that we are aligned in addressing the situation proactively.

Please let me know your availability for this meeting.

Best regards,

Mark Thompson
