Hi Thomas,

I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to touch base regarding the updates to our product features that are scheduled for next month. As we finalize the development phase, it would be great to gather some insights from our key clients to ensure everything aligns with their needs.

Despite our busy schedule, I believe itâ€™s crucial we reach out to clients like Bravocat to get their feedback on the latest functionalities. Their input could greatly influence our final adjustments and enhance our service delivery.

Could you assist in preparing a list of specific questions we should ask during our discussions with them? I want to make sure we maximize our engagement during the feedback sessions.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
