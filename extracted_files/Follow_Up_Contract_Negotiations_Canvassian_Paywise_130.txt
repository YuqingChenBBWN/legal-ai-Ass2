Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to take a moment to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the upcoming contract renewal between Canvassian Pty Ltd and Paywise. We appreciate the opportunity to work with your team and are excited about the potential to continue our collaboration.

As we discussed, I believe it would be beneficial for both parties to schedule a meeting to address any outstanding items and ensure that we are aligned on the terms going forward. Please let me know your availability next week, and we can coordinate a time that works for everyone.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
