**2. Introduction**

Canvassian Pty Ltd is set to launch Canvassian CloudSuite 2.0, a major upgrade to our flagship software. While the project is on schedule, several risks have been identified that could impact the success of the launch and client satisfaction. Given our reputation and reliance on key clients, it is imperative that we address these risks to avoid corporate repercussions.

**3. Key Risks Identified**

**3.1 Poor Product Launch**

*Issue*: A poor product launch, characterized by software bugs, system outages, or inadequate features, may severely impact our market position and customer trust.

*Analysis*:
- **Software Bugs & System Reliability**: Preliminary internal tests identified significant bugs in the beta version of CloudSuite 2.0. There's a possibility these issues may persist into the final release.
- **Feature Adequacy**: Feedback from beta testers suggests that certain features may not meet user expectations, particularly among our major clients.
- **Operational Readiness**: There are concerns over whether our support and maintenance teams are adequately prepared for a potential surge in customer issues post-launch.

*Consequences*:
- Loss of client trust and potential contract cancellations.
- Negative impact on brand reputation.
- Financial implications due to emergency fixes and customer compensations.

**3.2 Customer Dissatisfaction**

*Issue*: Customer dissatisfaction can arise from unmet expectations, lack of feature parity with competitors, inadequate customer support, or poor usability of the new product.

*Analysis*:
- **Expectations vs. Delivery**: Our key clients Paywise, Alphabear, Bravocat, Charlemont, Deltaforce, and Echona have high expectations. Failing to meet these could result in dissatisfaction.
- **Competitive Benchmarking**: Recent market analysis indicates competitors have advanced features that CloudSuite 2.0 currently lacks.
- **Customer Support**: Insufficient training and preparedness of the customer support team could result in prolonged resolution times and frustrated customers.

*Consequences*:
- Client churn: Major clients may seek alternative solutions.
- Revenue impact: Loss of key clients can significantly affect recurring revenue.
