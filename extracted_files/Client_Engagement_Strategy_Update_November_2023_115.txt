Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. 

I wanted to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the new client engagement strategy we are looking to implement for Canvassian. As we aim to strengthen our relationships with key clients like Paywise and Deltaforce, I believe itâ€™s critical that we align our marketing efforts with the sales team's on-the-ground insights.

Could you please provide an update on any feedback you've received from our engagement with Bravocat and Charlemont over the last month? Additionally, it would be great to schedule a brief meeting next week to discuss how we can integrate the upcoming marketing campaigns with your sales initiatives.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Michael Reed
