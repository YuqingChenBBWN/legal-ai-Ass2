Dear Jason,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with a brief update on the current status of the Canvassian Project, along with the upcoming milestones we need to focus on for the next quarter.

As of today, we have successfully completed the initial phases of software development and have entered the testing phase. The team has worked incredibly hard, and we are on track to meet our first major deadline at the end of this month. 

Looking ahead, here are the key milestones we’ll need to focus on:

1. **Beta Testing Launch**: Scheduled for March 30, 2024. Please ensure that all necessary documentation is prepared for the testing team.
  
2. **Client Feedback Collection**: We will begin collecting feedback from our key clients, including Paywise and Alphabear, starting April 10, 2024. I suggest we coordinate with their respective points of contact to facilitate this process.
  
3. **Final Release Preparation**: The target for the final release is May 15, 2024. I will be sending out a detailed timeline on deliverables shortly.

Additionally, I would like to schedule a brief meeting to address any concerns or questions you may have as we progress through these stages. Please let me know your availability for later this week or early next week.

Thank you for your continued efforts and support. Together, we’re making great strides!

Best regards,
