Dear Team Leads,

I hope this email finds you well! I would like to schedule a strategy meeting to discuss our upcoming product launch scheduled for next quarter. It’s crucial that we align on our objectives and approaches to ensure a successful rollout.

Please confirm your availability for next Wednesday, October 11th, at 10:00 AM AEST. The meeting will be held in the large conference room on the 3rd floor. Alternatively, if there are any conflicts, please suggest a different time that works for you.

In preparation for our discussion, I encourage you to come with updates on your respective teams’ progress and any potential challenges you foresee as we move towards the launch.

Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to our collective insights and strategies!

Best regards,

Sarah Mitchell
