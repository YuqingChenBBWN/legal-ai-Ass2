Hi David,

I hope this email finds you well!

I wanted to touch base regarding our recent project milestones, specifically those involving our clients. I believe we're making great progress with Charlemont, and their feedback on the last demo was encouraging. It seems they appreciate the enhancements we've made, which is fantastic to hear.

Can we schedule a time next week to discuss our strategies moving forward? I’d like to ensure we remain aligned with Charlemont’s expectations and plans.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
