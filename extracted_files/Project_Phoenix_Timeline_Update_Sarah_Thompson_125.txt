Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on the timeline for Project Phoenix, as discussed in our last team meeting.

We are currently on track to complete the development phase by the end of next month. The initial user testing is scheduled for the first two weeks of the following month, and I will ensure that the entire project team is prepared for that. We are still awaiting feedback from the marketing team on the promotional strategy. If you could follow up with them this week, that would be helpful.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to address or if you require additional information.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
