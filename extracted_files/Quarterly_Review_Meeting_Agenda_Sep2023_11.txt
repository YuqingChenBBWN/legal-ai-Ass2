Hi Marcus,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we prepare for our upcoming quarterly review meeting, I wanted to touch base regarding the agenda. I believe it would be beneficial to highlight our performance with key clients, including our successful project with Echona. Their feedback has been quite positive, and I think we should showcase this as a case study on how our solutions have added value.

Please let me know if youâ€™d like to include any other topics in the meeting agenda.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
