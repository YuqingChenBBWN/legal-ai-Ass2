Dear Edon,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out to discuss the upcoming timeline for the new software release project that our teams have been working on. As we approach the next phase, I think it would be beneficial for us to hold a meeting to review our progress and address any potential challenges that may impact our delivery schedule.

Could you please let me know your availability for a meeting next week? I suggest we aim for Tuesday or Wednesday morning if those times work for you.

Thank you for your continuous support.

Best regards,  
Sarah Johnson
