**Subject:** Upcoming Product Launch Meeting  

Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. As we move closer to the launch of our new software product, I would like to schedule a meeting next week to discuss the final details and ensure that all teams are aligned.

Please check your availability and let me know what day works best for you. I propose Wednesday or Thursday afternoon, but I'm open to other suggestions if those times are not convenient.

In the meeting, we will cover:
- Final testing updates
- Marketing strategy
- Client onboarding processes
- Support resources

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
