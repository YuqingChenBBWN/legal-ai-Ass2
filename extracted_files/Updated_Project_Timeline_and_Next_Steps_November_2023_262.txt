Dear Sarah,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion regarding the upcoming project timelines for the Canvassian software release.

After reviewing the feedback from the recent client meetings, we need to adjust our development and testing phases. Here is a proposed updated timeline:

- **Development Phase:** November 20 - December 15, 2023  
- **Testing Phase:** December 16 - January 10, 2024  
- **Launch Date:** January 15, 2024  

Please review the updated plan and let me know if you foresee any challenges or if additional resources are needed during the development phase.  

Additionally, I suggest scheduling a team meeting next week to discuss any concerns and ensure everyone is aligned on our next steps. Please provide your availability, and I will coordinate with the rest of the team.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
