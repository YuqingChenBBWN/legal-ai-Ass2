Dear Keith,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to discuss some developments within our leadership team that may be affecting the tech division.

As you might have heard through the grapevine, Edon Mask has been contemplating an offer that could potentially lead him to another opportunity outside of Canvassian. While Edon hasn’t made a definitive decision yet, it’s essential that we align ourselves for possible contingencies to ensure that our projects remain on track and the team continues to thrive.

Edon has done incredible work in his capacity as CTO, and if he were to leave, his presence and vision in the company would surely be missed. Given this situation, I believe it might be prudent to start thinking about our leadership structure should the need arise.

Let’s set up a time to discuss our current projects and how we could mitigate any potential disruptions. 

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
