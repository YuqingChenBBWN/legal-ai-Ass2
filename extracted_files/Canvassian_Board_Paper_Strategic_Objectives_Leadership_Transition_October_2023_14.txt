- **External Candidates:** A search for external candidates will also be conducted to ensure a wide range of options.
- **Interim Plan:** In the interim, COO Hannah Lee is proposed to serve as Acting CEO to ensure continuity.

### 5. Recommendations

1. **Endorse the Succession Plan:** Approve the initiation of the succession planning process to evaluate both internal and external candidates.
2. **Communicate Transparently:** Develop a communication strategy to inform employees and clients about the potential leadership transition.
3. **Retain Strategic Focus:** Ensure that transitional leadership prioritizes existing strategic objectives to maintain growth and stability.

### 6. Conclusion

Jane Wu's potential departure is a significant event for Canvassian Pty Ltd. However, with a solid succession plan and strategic focus, we can navigate this transition while continuing to build on our achievements. Approval of the proposed recommendations is sought.
