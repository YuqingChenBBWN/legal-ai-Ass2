Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the updates on our upcoming product launch scheduled for next month. 

As you know, Jane Wu has been quite enthusiastic about this launch, and her vision for the new features has really inspired the team. Let's ensure that we align all our strategies to meet her expectations.

Additionally, I would like to discuss the preparation for the demo presentation we need to deliver to our major clients soon. Could you let me know your availability for a meeting next week?

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,
