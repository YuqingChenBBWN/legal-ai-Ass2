Hi Tom,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent discussions about the upcoming quarterly client review meetings. As you know, it’s crucial for us to keep our major clients engaged and informed about our latest developments.

I’ve scheduled the review meeting with Paywise for next Friday, March 21, at 10 AM. It will be a great opportunity to showcase our recent product updates and discuss any feedback they might have. Please let me know if you’d like to join or if there's anything specific you would like me to address during the meeting.

Additionally, I will prepare a summary of our performance metrics over the last quarter and gather testimonials from the team to provide a more comprehensive overview.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best,  
Sarah Long
