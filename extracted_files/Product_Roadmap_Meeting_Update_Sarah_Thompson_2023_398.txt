**Subject:** Update on Product Roadmap Meeting  

Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding our upcoming product roadmap meeting scheduled for next Tuesday, October 10th, at 10:00 AM. 

I have reviewed the initial drafts that the product management team put together and have some feedback I'd like to discuss. Additionally, if you could ensure that the latest market analysis data is included in the presentation, it would greatly enhance our discussion.

Please confirm that you have all the required documents prepared before our meeting. If there are any other stakeholders you believe should be included in the discussion, feel free to loop them in.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
