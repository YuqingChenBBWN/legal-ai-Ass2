Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to remind everyone about our upcoming Quarterly Review Meeting scheduled for April 30, 2024, at 10:00 AM in the main conference room. 

We will be discussing our performance over the last quarter, key achievements, and strategizing our goals for the next quarter. It is essential that all team leaders prepare a brief update on their departments, highlighting successes and any challenges faced.

Please ensure that all presentations are submitted to me by April 28, 2024, so that I can compile them ahead of our meeting. Additionally, be prepared to engage in a discussion regarding our recent client feedback and how it can inform our future initiatives.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication. Looking forward to seeing everyone there.

Best regards,

Sarah Lee
