Subject: Corporate Risk Assessment - Echona Account

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

As part of our ongoing commitment to proactively manage corporate risks, I would like to bring to your attention some concerns regarding our client, Echona. Given their recent financial performance and changes in their executive leadership, we need to conduct a thorough risk assessment to determine any potential impact on our ongoing projects and partnership with them.

While Echona has been a valuable client to Canvassian, their recent budget constraints have raised flags about timely payments and overall project scope. Additionally, there are indications of potential shifts in their strategic direction, which could affect our collaborative initiatives.

I recommend we schedule a meeting with the finance and product management teams to discuss our findings and potential mitigation strategies. This will help us ensure that we are aligned and adequately prepared to address any upcoming challenges.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting next week.

Best regards,

Michael Thompson
