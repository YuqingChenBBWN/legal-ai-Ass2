Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the project proposal we discussed during last week's team meeting. It’s crucial that we finalize our strategies before we present them to our clients next week.

If you could share your thoughts on the draft by Friday, that would allow us enough time to make any necessary adjustments. I believe it's essential that we align our messaging with our core values and the expectations of our major clients – Paywise, Alphabear, Bravocat, Charlemont, Deltaforce, and Echona.

Additionally, I’d like to suggest a brief meeting on Thursday afternoon to go over our deliverables and ensure we’re all on the same page. Please let me know your availability.

Thank you for your hard work on this!

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
