Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring up a matter that has been increasingly concerning our team and could have implications for Canvassian's strategic direction moving forward.

There have been whispers regarding Edon Mask's potential departure from his role as CTO. Given that Edon has been such a central figure in driving our technological vision and innovation, this would undoubtedly have a significant impact on our projects and client relationships.

Could we arrange a time to discuss how we would like to approach this situation? It’s vital that we secure clarity on Edon’s intentions and potentially prepare a strategy to mitigate any disruptions should he decide to pursue other opportunities. Additionally, I believe it would be prudent to communicate with our major clients to maintain their confidence in our leadership during this time.

Please let me know when you are available for a meeting.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
