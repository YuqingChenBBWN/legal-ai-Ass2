Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for our upcoming quarterly review meeting next week, I wanted to ensure that we have all the necessary materials ready for discussion.

I believe it would be beneficial to include a segment that highlights our progress with Charlemont, as they've been a significant partner for us this quarter. If you could gather the latest performance metrics and any feedback weâ€™ve received from them, that would be great.

Please let me know if you need any assistance or further information from my side.

Looking forward to your input!

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
