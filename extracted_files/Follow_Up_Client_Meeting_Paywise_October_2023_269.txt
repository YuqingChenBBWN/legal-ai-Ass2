Hi Jason,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent meeting with Paywise. I think the discussion went really well, and I appreciated your insights on the technical aspects of the proposal. 

As we explore ways to enhance our offering for them, it might be beneficial to arrange a brainstorming session with the team next week. Our CEO, Jane Wu, has expressed her enthusiasm for tailoring our solutions to better serve our clients, and I'm certain she would support our proactive efforts.

Please let me know your availability, and I can coordinate a meeting time that works for everyone.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
