Subject: Q3 Project Update and Team Recognition

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. As we wrap up the third quarter, I wanted to take a moment to provide an update on our key projects and recognize some outstanding efforts.

Firstly, I’m pleased to report that we are on track with the development of our new software feature that aims to enhance client experience. This initiative has been a strategic focus for Canvassian, and I believe it will greatly align with our long-term goals as emphasized by Jane in our last all-hands meeting.

Additionally, I’d like to highlight the great collaboration between the product management and engineering teams, which has been crucial in ensuring our deadlines are met. Special thanks to Sarah Bell and Michael Turner for their leadership throughout this process. 

Let’s continue this momentum into the next quarter and keep pushing boundaries. If anyone has any updates or challenges they’d like to discuss, feel free to reach out.

Best regards,

Emily Chang
