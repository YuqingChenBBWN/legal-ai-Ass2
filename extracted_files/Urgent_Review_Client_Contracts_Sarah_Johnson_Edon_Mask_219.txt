Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing due diligence process in preparation for potential acquisition, I would like to bring to your attention the upcoming deadline for reviewing our contracts with major clients, particularly with Paywise and Alphabear.

It is crucial for us to ensure that all terms are up-to-date and that there are no outstanding issues that could impact client relations or the acquisition process. Please let me know your availability for a brief meeting this week to discuss any necessary changes and strategies moving forward.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
