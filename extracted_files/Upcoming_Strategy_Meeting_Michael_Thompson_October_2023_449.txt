Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. 

As we continue to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of our industry, I wanted to propose that we schedule a strategy meeting to discuss our current projects and the upcoming roadmap for the next quarter. It is essential that we align our goals and ensure that all teams are on the same page moving forward.

Please let me know your availability for next week so we can arrange a time that suits everyone involved. I believe this will be a great opportunity to brainstorm new ideas and enhance our collaboration across departments.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Michael Thompson
