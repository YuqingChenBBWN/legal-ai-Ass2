**Subject:** Update on Project Delta  

Dear Sarah,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update on Project Delta as we approach the next milestone. The team has made significant progress in the last couple of weeks, and we are on track to meet our deadlines.

We have successfully completed the initial testing phase, and the feedback from the beta users has been overwhelmingly positive. The developers are currently addressing a few minor issues that were raised, and we anticipate that the final adjustments will be completed by the end of the week.

Please prepare the presentation for the upcoming client meeting next Wednesday, where we will showcase the capabilities of Project Delta. It would be great to have a discussion point on the key upgrades based on the feedback received.

Let me know if you need any additional information or assistance in putting together the presentation.

Best regards,

Liam Foster
