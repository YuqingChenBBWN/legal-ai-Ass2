Dear Tara,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the status of the CanvasPro project. As we approach the end of the current phase, I believe itâ€™s essential to align on our next steps and ensure that we are on track to meet our deadlines.

Could you please provide an update on the current progress, as well as any potential challenges that the team has encountered? It would be great to schedule a brief meeting this week to discuss your insights and outline the actionable items moving forward.

As a reminder, the upcoming milestones for the project include:

1. Completion of the user interface design by October 15.
2. Finalization of the API integrations by October 22.
3. Full system testing set for the week of October 30.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting, and I will coordinate with the other team members.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication on this project. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!

Best regards,

Liam Thompson
