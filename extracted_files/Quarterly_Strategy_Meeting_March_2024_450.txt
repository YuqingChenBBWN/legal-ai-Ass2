Subject: Upcoming Quarterly Strategy Meeting

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the end of the quarter, I would like to schedule our upcoming Quarterly Strategy Meeting to discuss our performance, strategic objectives, and planning for the next quarter.

Please mark your calendars for Thursday, March 15, 2024, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The meeting will be held in the main conference room, and we will also provide a video link for remote participants.

To ensure that our discussion is productive, I would like each department head to prepare a brief report covering the following:

1. Key achievements from the last quarter
2. Current challenges faced
3. Proposed initiatives for the upcoming quarter

Please submit your reports to me by Monday, March 12, 2024, so I can compile them ahead of the meeting.

If you have any topics or additional items you would like to add to the agenda, please feel free to reach out to me by the end of this week.

Looking forward to our discussions and thank you for your continued hard work and dedication.

Best regards,

Emily Tran
