Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we move into the next quarter, I would like to schedule a strategy session to discuss our upcoming product launches and client engagement initiatives.

Please mark your calendars for Wednesday, March 15th at 10:00 AM AEST. We will meet in the main conference room. It is essential that each department representative comes prepared with key updates so that we can collaboratively shape our direction for the next few months.

If you have any topics or concerns that you believe should be included in our discussion, please feel free to reply to this email by the end of the week.

Thank you for your continuous hard work and dedication. I look forward to seeing all of you on March 15th!

Best regards,

Sarah Lee
