Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to take a moment to provide you with an update on the timeline for the upcoming project launch. As you know, the team has been working diligently over the past few weeks, and we have made significant progress.

Given the recent feedback from our key client, Paywise, we will need to adjust our launch date. Instead of the initial target of June 15th, I propose that we aim for a new launch date of July 1st. This will give us ample time to incorporate the necessary modifications and ensure that we meet, if not exceed, the expectations set forth by our clients.

Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed timeline. If you have any other suggestions or need further information, feel free to reach out.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Sarah Lawson
