Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the progress of our current project. As we approach the next phase, it will be crucial for everyone to be aligned on deliverables and timelines.

Iâ€™ve scheduled a team meeting for next week to discuss our progress and outline next steps. Jane will be joining us to share her insights, which I believe will be invaluable as we move forward.

Please ensure that all relevant documents and updates are ready to discuss. I appreciate your hard work and dedication to this project.

Looking forward to the meeting!

Best regards,
