Dear Thomas,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare to embark on our next phase of the “Project Odyssey” initiative, I believe it is essential to review the upcoming project timeline to ensure all team members are aligned on deliverables and deadlines.

I propose we hold a meeting on Thursday, October 10, 2023, at 10:00 AM in the large conference room to discuss this in detail. Please gather any relevant updates or concerns regarding your team’s responsibilities. I believe this will set us up for success as we move forward and strive to meet our client expectations.

Please let me know if this time works for you or if you suggest any changes.

Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
