Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to schedule a project review meeting for this coming Thursday at 10:00 AM. This meeting will provide an opportunity for us to assess our progress on the latest software updates and address any challenges that the team may be facing.

Please confirm your availability, and if there are any other team members you feel should join, let me know, and I can include them in the meeting invite.

Additionally, if you have any specific topics you would like to discuss, please send them my way so that we can prepare accordingly.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
