Subject: Alignment on Q3 Objectives

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of Q2, I wanted to take a moment to align on our objectives for the upcoming quarter. It’s important that we ensure we’re all on the same page as we continue to drive growth and deliver value to our clients.

Please review the attached document detailing our proposed Q3 targets, outlined not only by department but also reflecting our strategic goals for Canvassian. I would appreciate your feedback and any insights you might have by the end of the week. 

Let’s also consider scheduling a meeting to discuss these objectives further and address any questions you may have. I'll send out a calendar invite shortly.

Thank you for your continued dedication and hard work. Together, I’m confident we can make Q3 our most successful quarter yet!

Best regards,

Michael Torres
