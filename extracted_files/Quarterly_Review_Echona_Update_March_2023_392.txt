Hi John,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to touch base with you regarding our upcoming quarterly review scheduled for next week. 

As part of our preparation, I would like to ensure that we include an update on our operations with Echona. They have been quite pleased with the enhancements we implemented over the last quarter, and I believe it could highlight our capacity to adapt and meet client needs effectively.

Please let me know if you have any additional insights or points you would like to cover during the review, especially any metrics that showcase our growth with other key clients.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
