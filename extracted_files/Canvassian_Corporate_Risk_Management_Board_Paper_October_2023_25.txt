#### **1. Introduction**

This board paper is intended to provide an overview of current corporate risks facing Canvassian Pty Ltd and propose mitigation strategies to address these risks.

#### **2. Poor Product Launch**

**Background:**
Canvassian is on the verge of launching a new product, "CanvasPro," a revolutionary project management tool aimed at enhancing team productivity. The launch is scheduled for December 1, 2023. Concerns have been raised about the readiness of the product and the effectiveness of our pre-launch activities.

**Risks:**
1. **Technical Issues:** Potential bugs and technical glitches that may arise post-launch.
2. **Market Reception:** Lack of enthusiasm from the market due to inadequate marketing or unmet expectations.
3. **Operational Readiness:** Insufficient internal preparations such as staff training, support infrastructure, and operational workflows.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Rigorous Testing:** Extend the product's beta testing phase to encompass a wider group of users to identify and rectify remaining issues.
2. **Aggressive Marketing Campaign:** Increase marketing efforts to generate buzz and adequately inform potential users about the product's benefits.
3. **Staff Training Programs:** Implement extensive training programs for support staff and sales teams to ensure they are well-prepared for the launch.

#### **3. Customer Dissatisfaction**

**Background:**
Customer satisfaction has always been a key driver of Canvassian's success. Recent surveys indicate a decline in satisfaction levels among both major and minor clients.

**Risks:**
1. **Client Retention:** Dissatisfied customers may switch to competitors, leading to revenue loss.
2. **Brand Reputation:** Negative feedback could tarnish Canvassian's brand image.
3. **Referral Business:** Decrease in client referrals which are essential for attracting new clients.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Enhanced Customer Support:** Improve our customer support services by increasing staffing levels and providing additional training focused on customer care.
2. **Regular Feedback Systems:** Implement an ongoing customer feedback loop to monitor satisfaction levels and address concerns promptly.
3. **Product Improvement:** Act on feedback to make necessary product adjustments and enhancements.

#### **4. Poor Risk Controls**

**Background:**
The effectiveness of Canvassian’s risk control mechanisms is critical to managing both operational and strategic risks. Recent audits suggest gaps in our current risk management framework.

**Risks:**
1. **Operational Disruptions:** Potential for significant operational disruptions due to unidentified or improperly managed risks.
2. **Compliance Issues:** Non-adherence to regulatory requirements leading to legal and financial penalties.
3. **Strategic Failures:** Failure to align risk management practices with the company’s strategic objectives.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Risk Management Framework:** Develop and implement a comprehensive risk management framework aligned with industry best practices.
2. **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular internal and external audits to identify and address risk management gaps.
3. **Training Programs:** Introduce mandatory risk management training programs for all employees to enhance awareness and adherence to risk controls.

Effective risk management is critical to Canvassian’s continued success. The identified risks – a poor product launch, customer dissatisfaction, and inadequate risk controls – present significant challenges but also opportunities for strengthening our operations and market position.
