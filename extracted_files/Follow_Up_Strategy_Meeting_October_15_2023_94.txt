Dear Mark,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to follow up on our strategy meeting last week. I appreciate all the insights shared, particularly regarding our roadmap for the next quarter.

As discussed, it would be beneficial for us to finalize the deliverables for the upcoming project by the end of this week. I propose we schedule a brief catch-up session to streamline our tasks and ensure that everyone is aligned before we present our updates to the board.

Please let me know your availability, and if there are any additional points you believe we should address in our meeting.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
