Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well.

I want to bring to your attention a corporate risk that has arisen regarding our client, Echona. Recently, we have noticed a decline in their recent engagement with our software solutions, which could potentially impact our ongoing revenue streams and overall relationship with them.

According to the latest data from our sales and support teams, Echona has expressed concerns about integrating our latest software updates, resulting in a slowdown of their operations. It is crucial that we address these concerns promptly to reassure them about the effectiveness of the updates and provide any additional support they may need during this transition.

Furthermore, given Echona's significant role as one of our major clients, any decline in their satisfaction could pose a risk not only to our current contracts but also to any potential upselling opportunities in the future.

I propose that we schedule a meeting with the product management team to devise a targeted approach to re-engage Echona and offer them tailored support. It may also be worth considering setting up a direct communication pathway with their decision-makers to ensure transparency and understand their concerns in detail.

Please let me know your availability for this discussion, as I believe it's imperative we act swiftly to mitigate this risk and reinforce our partnership with Echona.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
