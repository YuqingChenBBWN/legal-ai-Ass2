Dear Mark,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the partnership proposal we discussed last week. Our team at Canvassian has put together a few additional insights and strategies that could align our technologies effectively to create even more value for both companies. 

Would you be available for a meeting next week to go over these ideas? We're eager to hear your thoughts and explore potential next steps. Please let me know a time that works for you, and Iâ€™ll coordinate with our team.

Thank you, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
