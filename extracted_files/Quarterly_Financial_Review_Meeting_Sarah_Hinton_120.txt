Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the quarter, I would like to schedule a meeting to review our financial performance and discuss projections for the upcoming quarter. This will be an important opportunity to assess our growth and identify areas where we can optimize our resources.

Please let me know your availability next week. I suggest we allocate about an hour for this discussion, as it will involve a comprehensive review of our expenditures, revenue streams, and potential investment opportunities.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Sarah Hinton
