**Dear Edon,**

I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the upcoming product launch, I would like to schedule a strategy meeting to align our teams on the final details and action items. Given the ambitious timelines, it is crucial that we ensure everyone is on the same page.

Could you please let me know your availability for a meeting this week? I propose we cover the following key points:

1. Final product specifications
2. Marketing and sales strategy
3. Client engagement approach
4. Post-launch support plan

I believe a one-hour meeting should suffice. I will coordinate a time that works for everyone once I hear back from you.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
