Dear Brian,

I hope this message finds you well. 

I wanted to provide you with an update on our client onboarding process for the past quarter. As you are aware, we have recently signed agreements with two new clients, Bravocat and Deltaforce, which we expect to onboard over the next few weeks. 

Our team has been actively coordinating with their project leads to ensure a smooth transition. I've attached the updated onboarding timeline and necessary resource allocations for your review. Please feel free to add any insights based on your previous experience in integrations that might assist us in this process.

Additionally, I suggest we schedule a follow-up meeting next week to discuss any challenges or outstanding issues. Let me know your availability.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Sarah Mitchell
