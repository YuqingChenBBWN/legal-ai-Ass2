Dear Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the end of the current quarter, I wanted to schedule a meeting to discuss our performance metrics and projections for the next quarter. Itâ€™s important that we assess our current strategies and make any necessary adjustments to ensure we meet our goals.

Please let me know your availability for next week so that I can coordinate with Lisa and Jake as well. I suggest a 1-hour meeting on either Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon if that works for you.

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards,
