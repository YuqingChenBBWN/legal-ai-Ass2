Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent quarterly financial review meeting held on October 10th. During our discussion, we made significant progress in outlining our current financial standing and identifying key areas for improvement.

As per our conversation, I would appreciate it if you could send me the final reports by the end of this week, so we can prepare for our next board meeting scheduled for October 20th. This would ensure that we have all necessary data at hand to provide a comprehensive update to the board members.

Additionally, if you could share any feedback from the sales and marketing teams regarding their projections for the next quarter, that would be beneficial for our financial planning.

Thank you for your cooperation. Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
