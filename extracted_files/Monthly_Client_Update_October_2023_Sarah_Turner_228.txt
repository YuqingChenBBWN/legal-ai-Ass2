Hi Jonathan,

I hope this email finds you well! As we wrap up this month, I wanted to share some updates regarding our ongoing projects and client relationships.

We had a productive meeting with Paywise last week, where we discussed their upcoming needs and how our new features can support them further. The feedback was quite positive, and they are excited about the next steps we outlined.

Additionally, weâ€™re making good progress on our internal initiatives, and I believe we are on track to meet our quarterly goals. Let me know if you would like to discuss any specific clients or projects in our next team meeting.

Looking forward to catching up soon!

Best,
