Subject: Follow-up on Recent Client Meeting

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your time during our recent meeting. It was great to catch up and discuss the ongoing projects at Canvassian.

I’m particularly excited about the progress we’re making with our clients, including Alphabear. Their feedback has been instrumental in refining our product offerings, and we anticipate a successful rollout in the coming weeks.

Please let me know if you need anything further from my end, or if there’s a good time for us to touch base again next week.

Best regards,

Michael Thompson  
Head of Client Relations
