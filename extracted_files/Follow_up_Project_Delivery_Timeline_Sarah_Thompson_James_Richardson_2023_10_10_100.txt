Dear James,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming delivery timeline for the software enhancements we’ve been collaborating on. As we approach the final stages of development, it’s crucial that we stay aligned to ensure a smooth rollout. 

I'm pleased to see that our teams have made significant progress, especially in addressing the feedback we received during our last meeting. I appreciate the input from your team at Bravocat; it has truly aided in refining our approach.

Please let me know if you could set up a call sometime this week to further discuss any remaining concerns and finalize our next steps. 

Looking forward to your reply!

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
