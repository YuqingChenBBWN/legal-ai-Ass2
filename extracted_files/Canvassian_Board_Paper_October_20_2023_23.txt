**Canvassian Pty Ltd**
**Board Paper**
**Date:** October 20, 2023

**To:** Board of Directors  
**From:** Jane Wu, CEO  
**Subject:** Regular Reporting and Potential Acquisition Deal  

**1. Introduction**
This board paper aims to provide an overview of our current status regarding regular business reporting and updates on potential acquisition by a yet-to-be-disclosed entity. We will discuss our financials, operational performance, and strategic positioning, as well as some insights into the potential acquisition deal.

**2. Financial Performance**
2.1 **Monthly Financial Reports**  
Our latest financial performance reports are robust, showing positive trends in revenue and profitability. We saw a 15% increase in quarterly revenue compared to the previous quarter, driven primarily by new contract wins and upselling to our existing clients. Our EBITDA has improved by 12%, reflecting better cost management and operational efficiencies. Both liquidity and solvency ratios are healthy, aligning with our long-term financial sustainability goals.

2.2 **Client Revenue Breakdown**  
Our top five clients—Paywise, Alphabear, Bravocat, Charlemont, and Deltaforce—continue to drive the majority of our revenue. Collectively, they represent 60% of our revenue, with minor clients contributing the remaining 40%. This spread helps mitigate risk, ensuring we are not overly dependent on any single client.

**3. Operational Performances**
3.1 **Product Development**  
Our software engineering teams, led by CTO Edon Mask, have successfully launched two new features in our flagship product that received positive client feedback. Continuous integration and deployment pipelines have been refined further, reducing the time-to-market for high-priority updates and bug fixes.

3.2 **Sales and Marketing**  
Our sales teams have achieved 95% of this quarter’s targets, thanks to intensive training and new incentive plans. Additionally, our marketing initiatives, particularly the digital campaigns, have garnered higher engagement rates, contributing to the lead generation funnel.

**4. Strategic Positioning**
4.1 **Market Expansion**  
We remain committed to expanding our market presence in Australia and exploring opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. Current market analysis indicates a strong demand for our software solutions, especially in the financial services and healthcare sectors.

**5. Potential Acquisition Deal**
5.1 **Background**  
We have entered preliminary discussions with a prospective acquirer interested in Canvassian Pty Ltd. While these discussions are still in the early stages, they demonstrate the market's recognition of our value and potential.

5.2 **Current Progress**  
The prospective acquirer has completed an initial review of our financials and operational metrics. They have expressed interest in conducting a comprehensive due diligence process over the next few months. A confidentiality agreement has been signed to facilitate the exchange of sensitive information.

5.3 **Opportunities and Risks**  
This acquisition opportunity could accelerate our growth strategies by providing access to additional financial and strategic resources. However, it also brings risks, including cultural integration challenges and potential disruptions to ongoing projects. It is imperative that we mitigate these risks through thorough planning and transparent communication.

**6. Recommendations**
6.1 **Maintain Regular Reporting**  
Continue with our rigorous financial and operational reporting to provide a clear picture of our health and progress. Enhancements in our reporting processes could further facilitate transparency and informed decision-making.

6.2 **Due Diligence Preparation**  
Prepare diligently for the due diligence process, ensuring that all documentation and data are accurate, comprehensive, and readily accessible. Designate key personnel to coordinate this effort.

6.3 **Engage Advisors**  
Consider engaging financial and legal advisors who specialize in mergers and acquisitions to guide us through this process, ensuring that we maximize the potential benefits while mitigating associated risks.

**7. Conclusion**
The Board of Directors’ support will be crucial as we navigate this potential acquisition while maintaining our operational performance and strategic initiatives. I recommend scheduling a special board meeting within the next two weeks to discuss the acquisition progress and address any queries.
