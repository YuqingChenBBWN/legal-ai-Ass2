**Subject:** Potential Litigation from Alphabear over Patent Breach Allegations

---

### **Purpose**

To inform the Board about the potential litigation risk Canvassian Pty Ltd faces from Alphabear, one of our key clients, over alleged patent infringement related to our flagship product, CanvasSoft 7.0.

---

### **Executive Summary**

Alphabear has issued a notice alleging that Canvassian's CanvasSoft 7.0 infringes on their patented technology related to real-time data processing. The potential litigation, if pursued, could have significant financial implications and damage our reputation. This paper outlines the nature of the allegations, preliminary legal assessments, potential impact, risk mitigation strategies, and recommendations for the Board's consideration.

### **Background**

On September 29, 2023, Alphabear's legal team sent a formal notice to Canvassian alleging that the data processing algorithms used in CanvasSoft 7.0 infringe on their patent (Patent No. AB123456). Alphabear is demanding either a cessation of the use of their patented technology and subsequent removal of CanvasSoft 7.0 from the market, or a licensing agreement that would involve substantial royalty payments.

### **Preliminary Legal Assessment**

1. **Patent Examination:**
   - Alphabear's patent AB123456 pertains to specific data processing methods designed to enhance real-time analytics performance.
   - Our initial legal review indicates that while there are similarities, significant differences exist in the implementation of the algorithms. 

2. **Likelihood of Success:**
   - Given the patent's wording and the prior art available, our legal counsel believes there is a reasonable ground to argue that Canvassian’s software is sufficiently distinct.
   - However, the risk of litigation cannot be completely dismissed and the outcome remains uncertain.

### **Potential Impact**

1. **Financial:**
   - Legal Costs: Estimated legal fees could reach AUD 1.5 million in case of a prolonged legal battle.
   - Potential Damages: If the court rules in favor of Alphabear, Canvassian could face damages up to AUD 10 million.
   - Licensing Costs: If we opt for a settlement involving licensing, annual royalty payments could be around AUD 2 million.

2. **Operational:**
   - Product Development: A requirement to redesign our algorithms could delay future releases and reallocate resources.
   - Client Relations: Our reputation could suffer, leading to potential loss of clients and revenue.

3. **Reputational:**
   - Negative Press: Media coverage of the lawsuit could tarnish Canvassian’s brand image.
   - Stakeholder Confidence: Investor and client confidence could be impacted by the ongoing litigation risk.

### **Risk Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Legal Strategy:**
   - Engage a top-tier intellectual property law firm to represent Canvassian.
   - Prepare a robust defense emphasizing the distinctions in our technology and the prior art.

2. **Operational Adjustments:**
   - Initiate alternative product development pathways that avoid the disputed technology.
   - Secure interim agreements with key clients to assure them of our product’s compliance and continuity.

3. **Stakeholder Communication:**
   - Develop a clear communication plan to inform our clients and stakeholders without triggering alarm.
   - Prepare a public relations response to manage any media inquiries.

### **Recommendations**

1. Authorize the engagement of top-tier legal counsel with expertise in intellectual property to handle the case immediately.
2. Allocate a contingency fund of AUD 3 million to cover potential legal expenses and initial damages.
3. Initiate discussions with Alphabear to explore an amicable settlement, including possible licensing agreements, whilst concurrently preparing for litigation.
4. Assign a cross-functional task force to develop alternative algorithms and expedite product updates that circumvent the disputed technology.
5. Prepare a comprehensive communication strategy to manage potential reputational risks.

---

### **Conclusion**

The litigation risk posed by Alphabear's patent infringement claim represents a significant challenge to Canvassian. Prompt, decisive action is required to mitigate the financial, operational, and reputational impacts. The recommendations provided aim to navigate the company through this potential crisis effectively.
