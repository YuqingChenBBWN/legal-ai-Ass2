---

Dear Jane,

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing risk management initiatives, I wanted to bring to your attention a potential corporate risk that we are currently assessing in relation to our client, Charlemont.

During our recent discussions with Charlemont, we identified some emerging concerns regarding their data security practices. Given the sensitive nature of the projects we are handling for them, there is a heightened risk that may affect both our reputation and operations. The key risks include the following:

1. **Data Breaches**: Charlemont has reported previous minor incidents of data unauthorized access which could escalate into more significant issues if not addressed promptly.
   
2. **Compliance Risks**: The recent changes in regulatory requirements around data protection may pose additional challenges for Charlemont, impacting their ability to meet compliance standards and, in turn, our contractual obligations.

3. **Client Dependency**: Charlemont represents a substantial portion of our revenue stream. Any adverse events could not only affect their business but also our long-term partnership and financial forecasts.

I recommend that we schedule a meeting with key stakeholders to discuss our strategy for mitigating these risks and enhancing our support for Charlemont. This proactive approach will help us ensure we are prepared for any challenges that may arise.

Please let me know your preferred time for this discussion, and I will coordinate with the relevant teams.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
