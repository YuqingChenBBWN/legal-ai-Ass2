Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well! 

I wanted to touch base regarding our current projects and see if there are any updates on the integration we’re working on with Paywise. Their feedback has been very positive so far, and I believe we’re on track to meet our timelines. 

Additionally, if you could provide me insight into the testing phases for the upcoming release, that would be greatly appreciated. Let’s ensure all departments are aligned before the next milestone meeting.

Thanks for your hard work on this!

Best,  
Sarah Thompson
