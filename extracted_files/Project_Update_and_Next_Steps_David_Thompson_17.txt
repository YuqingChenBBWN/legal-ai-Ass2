Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. 

I wanted to take a moment to update you on the progress of the new client onboarding project. We’ve made significant strides this week, and the team has been working diligently to ensure we meet our deadlines. 

Jane Wu emphasized the importance of maintaining strong relationships with our clients, and I believe our increased focus on their needs is starting to show positive results. I’d love to get your thoughts on how we can further enhance our client engagement strategy.

Let’s schedule a time to discuss this further.

Best regards,  
David Thompson
