From: Amelia Richards, Sales Manager  
To: Edon Mask, CTO; Jane Wu, CEO; Lucas Bennett, Head of Marketing  

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the end of Q3, I wanted to propose a meeting to discuss our sales strategy for Q4. It is crucial that we align our efforts and set our targets to ensure we finish the year strong.

Proposed Agenda:
1. Review of Q3 Sales Performance
2. Strategies to enhance client acquisition and retention
3. Discussion on enabling tools and resources needed
4. Setting fiscal targets for Q4

Please let me know your availability next week, and I will coordinate a time that works for everyone.

Thank you and looking forward to our discussions.

Best regards,
