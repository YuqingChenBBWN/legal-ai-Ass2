Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well.  

I wanted to provide you with a quick update on the ongoing projects. The development team has made significant progress on the platform enhancements for Paywise and Bravocat. Additionally, I've received positive feedback from Charlemont regarding the latest updates we implemented last month. They appreciate our responsiveness and are excited about the upcoming features.

Let's schedule some time this week to discuss any potential improvements we can make based on this feedback.  

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
