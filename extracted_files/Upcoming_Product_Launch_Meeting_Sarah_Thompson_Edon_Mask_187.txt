Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the upcoming launch of our new product. As the launch date is fast approaching, itâ€™s essential for the product and engineering teams to synchronize their efforts and address any final outstanding issues.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting next week. I believe a 1-hour session would be sufficient to cover all necessary points.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
