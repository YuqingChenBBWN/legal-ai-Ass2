**Subject:** Corporate Risk Assessment â€“ Deltaforce Client Engagement

Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well.

As part of our ongoing risk assessment initiatives, I wanted to bring to your attention some potential corporate risks that we've identified concerning our engagement with Deltaforce. Given their market volatility and the recent fluctuations in their operational performance, a thorough evaluation is essential.

1. **Financial Stability:** Deltaforce has recently experienced a series of inconsistent quarterly results, leading to concerns about their cash flow and creditworthiness. We should consider potential impacts on our revenues derived from them.

2. **Operational Dependency:** As Deltaforce accounts for a significant portion of our revenue, any major deviation in their business operations (such as management changes or strategic redirection) could disproportionately affect our income. 

3. **Regulatory Compliance:** There have been emerging compliance pressures within Deltaforce's sector that could pose a risk to our partnership. If Deltaforce does not maintain stringent compliance practices, it could lead to reputational damage for Canvassian.

Given these considerations, I would recommend scheduling a risk review session with our senior management team to discuss possible mitigation strategies and how we might proactively engage with Deltaforce to fortify our partnership.

Please let me know a suitable time for this discussion.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
