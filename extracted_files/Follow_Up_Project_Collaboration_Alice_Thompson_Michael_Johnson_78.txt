Subject: Follow-Up on Project Collaboration

From: Alice Thompson (Product Manager, Canvassian Pty Ltd)  
To: Michael Johnson (Business Development Manager, Canvassian Pty Ltd)

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to touch base regarding our upcoming project timelines and deliverables for our clients. I believe we are making great strides, but it’s essential we maintain clear communication moving forward.

Also, I had a brief chat with our client Paywise last week, and they expressed their excitement about the integration features we’re working on. It’s a positive indication of our efforts paying off, and I believe it could open up additional opportunities for us.

Let’s schedule a meeting to review our action items and ensure everything is on track. How does Wednesday at 10 AM sound?

Best regards,  
Alice Thompson
