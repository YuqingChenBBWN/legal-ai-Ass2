Dear Daniel,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to schedule a meeting for the Quarterly Sales Review to discuss our performance, key metrics, and strategy moving forward. 

Please let me know your availability for next week. I believe it's crucial to assess how we can continue to enhance our sales approach and better serve clients like Paywise and Deltaforce.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
