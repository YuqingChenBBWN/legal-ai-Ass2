### 2. Background

On September 15, 2023, Canvassian launched its latest software product, Canvas360. The product aimed to enhance user experience with advanced data visualization capabilities.

#### 3.2 Customer Dissatisfaction

* **Issue:** The technical issues have led to increasing customer complaints and negative reviews. Major clients and dozens of minor clients have expressed concerns about the reliability and effectiveness of Canvas360. 
* **Impact:** The dissatisfaction risks eroding Canvassian's market reputation, jeopardizing existing contracts, and hindering new business opportunities.

### 4. Proposed Actions
