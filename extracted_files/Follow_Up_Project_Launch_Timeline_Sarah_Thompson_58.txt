**Dear Edon,**

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the upcoming launch timeline for our new software update. As we approach the final phases of development, it's crucial that we align on the key milestones to ensure a smooth rollout.

Could we schedule a meeting this week to discuss the details? I believe a thorough review of the current progress and any potential roadblocks will set us on the right path. Please let me know your available times.

Additionally, Iâ€™d like to hear your input on the marketing strategy and any support we might need from the tech team for a successful launch.

Thank you, and I look forward to your reply.

Warm regards,
