Subject: Upcoming Project Milestone Review

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we approach the end of the current project phase, I would like to schedule a meeting to review our milestones, assess our progress, and discuss any roadblocks that may require our attention. Your input is essential to ensure we stay on track and meet our deadlines.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting next week. A preliminary agenda will be shared once we finalize the date and time. 

Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication.

Best regards,
