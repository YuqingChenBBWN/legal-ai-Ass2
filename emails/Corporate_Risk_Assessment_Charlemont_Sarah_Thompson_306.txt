**Subject:** Corporate Risk Assessment for Charlemont  

Dear Michael,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention some concerns regarding our client, Charlemont. As you know, they have been an integral part of our client portfolio, and we need to ensure we maintain a healthy relationship while managing any associated risks.

Recently, there have been indications of financial difficulties within Charlemont. Their recent quarterly reports show a drop in revenue streams, which is concerning. Given that they contribute a significant portion of our revenue, this downturn could pose a corporate risk for us.

I recommend that we schedule a meeting with the risk management team to discuss our position and develop a contingency plan. It may also be prudent to reassess our contracts with them and consider the implications should we not receive timely payments moving forward.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting next week to discuss this matter in more detail.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
