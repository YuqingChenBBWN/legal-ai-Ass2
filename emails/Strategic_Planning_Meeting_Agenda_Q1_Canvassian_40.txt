Subject: Upcoming Strategic Planning Meeting

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I would like to schedule a strategic planning meeting to discuss our objectives for the upcoming quarter and the potential expansion into new markets. Your insights will be crucial as we map out our roadmap moving forward.

Please check your calendars for availability next week. I propose Wednesday at 2 PM, but I am open to alternative times if that does not work for everyone. Kindly respond by the end of the week so we can finalize the details.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your input!

Best regards,

Michael Thompson
