Hi Mark,

I hope this email finds you well. 

I wanted to follow up on our discussion from this morning regarding the development timeline for the new features. I believe aligning our release schedule with Bravocatâ€™s upcoming project timeline could be advantageous. Their feedback has always been constructive, and I think we can leverage that relationship further.

Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to arrange a quick sync with the product management team next week to ensure everyone is on the same page before we move forward.

Let me know your availability.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
