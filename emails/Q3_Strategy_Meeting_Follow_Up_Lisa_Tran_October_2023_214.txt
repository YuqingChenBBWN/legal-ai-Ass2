Hi Jacob,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to thank you for your valuable contributions during our Q3 strategy meeting last week. Your insights into market trends are always enlightening.

I also wanted to touch base about our ongoing projects and the upcoming deadlines. I think we should prioritize our work with Paywise, as theyâ€™ve expressed interest in expanding their suite of services with us. Their feedback was very positive, and it seems there are great opportunities to strengthen our partnership moving forward.

Let's set up a time next week to discuss our initiatives and how we can better serve our clients, including Paywise and others. Please let me know your availability.

Best regards,  
Lisa Tran
