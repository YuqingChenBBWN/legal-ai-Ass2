Hi Tom,

I hope this email finds you well! I wanted to take a moment to give you a brief update on our projects this week.

The development team has been making excellent progress on the new feature set for our key clients. Iâ€™m particularly excited about the feedback we received from Bravocat during our last meeting; they seem very pleased with the initial prototypes we shared.

Additionally, the sales team is finalizing the approach for our next client engagement, and I believe we'll have some positive news to share soon.

Let me know if you need anything specific or if you'd like to discuss this in more detail.

Best,  
Sarah Lewis
