Subject: Upcoming Strategy Meeting Input Request

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we prepare for our upcoming strategy meeting scheduled for next Thursday, I would like to gather input from each of you regarding our current projects, challenges, and opportunities for growth. Your insights are invaluable to our discussions and will help ensure that we are all aligned on our goals moving forward.

Please take some time to reflect on your team's performance over the past quarter and any initiatives you believe we should focus on. I encourage you to include any measurable outcomes from your projects that can support our decision-making process. 

Feel free to send me your thoughts and ideas by the end of this week so that we can compile them for our meeting agenda. 

Thank you for your hard work and dedication.

Best regards,

Rachel Kim
