Hi Jennifer,

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss our Q3 marketing strategy and finalize the planned initiatives as we prepare for the upcoming quarter. Please let me know your availability for a meeting next week so we can align our objectives and ensure that we are on track to meet our goals.

I have attached a presentation that outlines our proposed strategies and current metrics for your review ahead of our discussion.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,

Richard Thompson
