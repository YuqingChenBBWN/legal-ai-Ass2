**Subject:** Corporate Risk Assessment - Echona  

Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we prepare for the upcoming quarterly review, I wanted to bring to your attention a potential corporate risk associated with our engagement with Echona. Recent developments in their financial stability have raised some concerns that we should address proactively.

Our assessment team has highlighted that Echona has recently faced delays in project delivery, which has led to rising dissatisfaction among their end clients. This, coupled with recent turnover in their senior management team, poses a risk not only to our contracts with them but also to potential revenue forecasts. Additionally, any disruption in Echona's operations could impact our service delivery timelines.

It might be prudent for us to schedule a meeting to discuss a contingency plan and highlight any necessary actions we should take to mitigate this risk. We should also consider informing the executive team about these developments during our next strategy session.

Please let me know your availability over the next few days so we can find a suitable time to convene.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
