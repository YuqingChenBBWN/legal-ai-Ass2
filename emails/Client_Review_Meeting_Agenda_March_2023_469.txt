Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to remind you about our upcoming client review meeting scheduled for next Thursday, March 30th at 10:00 AM AEST. This meeting will be an excellent opportunity for us to present our latest product updates and gather feedback from our major clients, including Paywise and Deltaforce.

Please ensure that you have the latest performance metrics and product development highlights ready for the presentation. It would also be beneficial to discuss any challenges weâ€™ve faced and our strategies to address them.

If you have any additional topics you'd like to include in the agenda, please let me know by the end of the day tomorrow, so I can send out a final agenda to everyone involved.

Looking forward to our collaborative effort in making this meeting a success!

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
