**Subject:** Update on Client Proposal for Charlemont  

Dear Mark,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the proposal we submitted to Charlemont last week. They expressed interest in our software solutions, and I believe that we have a strong chance of winning this contract.

To ensure we are fully prepared for the upcoming meeting with their team, could you please provide me with an update on the latest features we have developed? This information will help us tailor our presentation more effectively to their needs.

Additionally, I think it would be beneficial for us to review the feedback we received from Paywise on their implementation experience. If we can incorporate any lessons learned into our pitch for Charlemont, it would strengthen our case.

Please let me know when you have time to discuss this further. Iâ€™d like to have everything wrapped up by Wednesday so that we can brainstorm ideas ahead of our meeting on Friday.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
