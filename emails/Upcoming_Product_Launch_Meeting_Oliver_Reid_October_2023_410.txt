Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well! 

I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming product launch meeting scheduled for next week. Itâ€™s crucial that we present a cohesive strategy, especially since Jane Wu emphasized the importance of clarity in our product messaging during our last leadership meeting.

Could you please ensure that the latest updates from the development team are included in the presentation? This will help us align our objectives and showcase the hard work everyone has been putting in.

Thanks for your attention to this matter! Looking forward to our collaboration.

Best regards,  
Oliver Reid  
Product Manager
