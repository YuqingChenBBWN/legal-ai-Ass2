Dear Matthew,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to schedule a strategic planning meeting to discuss our objectives for the upcoming quarter. Given the recent advancements in our software solutions and the positive feedback from our major clients, I believe it's crucial for us to align on our goals and explore opportunities for further growth.

Could you please provide your availability for next week? I suggest we aim for either Tuesday or Thursday afternoon, but I am open to alternative dates that work for you.

I will prepare a preliminary agenda and share it before the meeting, aiming to ensure that we make the most of our time together.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
