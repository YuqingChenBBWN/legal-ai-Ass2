Subject: Upcoming Strategy Meeting

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to remind everyone of our upcoming strategy meeting scheduled for Thursday, March 16, 2023, at 10:00 AM in the main conference room. This meeting will be an opportunity for us to discuss our objectives for the next quarter, review progress on our current projects, and explore potential areas for innovation.

Please come prepared with your updates and any materials you think will contribute to our discussion. If you have specific topics that you would like to add to the agenda, feel free to email me by the end of the day tomorrow.

Additionally, we will be joined by Jane Wu, our CEO, who will share her vision for the company moving forward. It is important that we all participate actively during her presentation and discussion.

Thank you, and I look forward to seeing you all soon.

Best Regards,

Liam Thompson
