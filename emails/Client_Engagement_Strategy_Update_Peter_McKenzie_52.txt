Subject: Important Update on Client Engagement Strategy

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we continue to enhance our client engagement strategy, I wanted to provide you with an important update on our upcoming initiatives. In line with our goals to strengthen relationships with both our major and minor clients, we will be launching a series of workshops and feedback sessions over the next quarter.

During these workshops, we aim to gather insights from our clients to better understand their needs and how we can support them more effectively. This initiative will include targeted outreach to our major clients such as Paywise, Alphabear, Bravocat, Charlemont, Deltaforce, and Echona, as well as a selection of our minor clients.

I am asking each team to prepare a brief report on their current client engagement strategies to share during our initial planning meeting scheduled for next Tuesday at 10 AM in the main conference room. Your input will be invaluable as we set the agenda for these client workshops.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Letâ€™s work together to ensure that we continue to provide exceptional service and support to all our clients.

Best regards,

Peter McKenzie
