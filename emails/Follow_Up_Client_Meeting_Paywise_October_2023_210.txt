Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well!

I wanted to follow up regarding our meeting with Paywise last week. I believe we had a productive discussion about the new features they are looking to implement. It would be great to align on the next steps regarding our proposal and potential timelines for delivery.

Could you please provide a summary of the key points discussed, along with any action items that emerged? This will help us ensure that we are all on the same page as we move forward.

Additionally, if there are any other clients you think we should reach out to about similar features, please let me know.

Thanks for your assistance!

Best regards,
