Hi Lawrence,

I hope this email finds you well!  

I wanted to touch base regarding our recent discussions about the upcoming software rollout. The team is making great progress, and we're currently on schedule to meet the projected timeline. I believe our work with clients like Echona has really refined our approach, allowing us to deliver even more effectively.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further details about the project.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
