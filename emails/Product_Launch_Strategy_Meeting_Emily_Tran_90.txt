Dear David,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we gear up for the upcoming product launch, I would like to schedule a strategy meeting to discuss our approach and finalize the timeline. Itâ€™s crucial that we align our teams to maximize the effectiveness of our launch and ensure a smooth roll-out.

Please let me know your availability this week so we can gather key members from the product, marketing, and sales teams. I also suggest including Adam from the finance department to ensure we stay within budget.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,

Emily Tran
