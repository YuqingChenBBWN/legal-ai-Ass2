Hi Lisa,

I hope youâ€™re having a great week! I wanted to send you a quick update regarding our current product development initiatives and how we can better align marketing efforts with our client needs.

Our team has been making significant progress on the new features we discussed during the last meeting. We believe these updates will enhance user experience for all clients, particularly our major partners like Paywise. Their feedback has been invaluable in shaping our product roadmap, and I think it's essential we highlight this collaboration in our upcoming marketing materials.

Additionally, I would love to schedule a time next week to go over the draft of our marketing strategy for the new release. Please let me know your availability.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
