Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention a concerning issue that has emerged regarding a potential litigation risk we may face. It has come to my attention that we have received a formal notice from one of our competitors, Innovatech Corp, claiming that our software platform infringes on their recently patented technology.

The notice cites several features of our product, particularly in the predictive analytics module, as potential breaches of their intellectual property rights. Given Innovatech’s aggressive stance in the market, this situation could escalate quickly and lead to a regulatory investigation or even a lawsuit.

I recommend we convene a meeting with the legal team early next week to assess our position and explore potential strategies for mitigating this risk. Additionally, I think it’s essential we gather detailed documentation of our development processes to demonstrate our innovation and adherence to IP regulations. 

Please let me know your availability, and I’ll coordinate accordingly. It’s crucial we address this matter with the urgency it deserves to protect our company and our clients. 

Best regards,  
Sarah Jenkins
