Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to touch base regarding our upcoming project update meeting scheduled for this Thursday at 10:00 AM. It would be great to review the current status of our initiatives and discuss any challenges we may be facing. Please ensure that your team is prepared with their updates and any pertinent data for discussion.

Additionally, if there are any specific topics you would like to cover during the meeting, please share those with me by the end of the day tomorrow so we can allocate enough time on the agenda.

Looking forward to our conversation.

Best regards,
