Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. 

I wanted to take a moment to provide you with an update on the current projects we have in the pipeline, as we approach the end of this quarter. As you are aware, our team has been diligently working on the integration features for the Deltaforce client, and Iâ€™m pleased to report that we are on schedule to meet the launch date of May 15th.

Additionally, I would like to remind you of the upcoming deadline for the product manager proposals which is set for April 30th. Please ensure that all submissions are finalized by the end of the week.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss any specific project in more detail. I appreciate your continued efforts and collaboration.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
