Subject: Upcoming Team Strategy Meeting

Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well!

As we approach the end of the quarter, it's crucial that we align on our strategy moving forward. To this end, I would like to schedule a team strategy meeting for next week. This will give us the opportunity to discuss our goals for the upcoming projects and ensure that we are all on the same page.

I would also like to take this chance to reflect on the leadership that Jane has provided us. Her vision and support have been instrumental in driving our initiatives forward, and it's vital that we continue to embody that spirit as we move into the next phase.

Please share your availability for a meeting this week, and I will coordinate a time that works for everyone.

Looking forward to your responses!

Best,
