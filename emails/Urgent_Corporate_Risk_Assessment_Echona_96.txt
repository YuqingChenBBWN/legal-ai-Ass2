**Subject:** Urgent: Corporate Risk Assessment for Client Echona

**From:** Sarah Thompson, Senior Risk Manager  
**To:** Jane Wu, CEO

**Dear Jane,**

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention a potential corporate risk that has emerged concerning our client, Echona.

Recently, we have received feedback indicating that Echona is experiencing operational challenges that may affect their timely payments and overall contract adherence. Their internal management team has expressed some concerns about supply chain disruptions which could impact their operational capacity, potentially leading to delays in service that would affect our deliverables.

Given our strong partnership with Echona and the significance of their contributions to our revenue stream, I recommend we initiate a deeper risk analysis. This will enable us to understand the extent of the impact and devise a contingency plan should the situation escalate further.

I suggest scheduling a meeting with the relevant stakeholders, including Edon, to discuss this matter in more detail. Additionally, it would be beneficial to possibly reach out to Echona's contacts to gain a clearer insight into their current pressures and how we might support them during this period.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter, and if you would like me to coordinate the meeting.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
