Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to provide you with an update on the development of the new software features we discussed in the last meeting. Our engineering team has completed the initial coding phase for the user analytics module and is currently in the testing phase. We aim to have this feature ready for deployment by the end of next month, pending successful test results.

Additionally, I will be gathering feedback from our major clients, specifically Paywise and Bravocat, to ensure we align with their expectations. If there are any specific aspects you would like me to focus on during these discussions, please let me know.

For our next steps, I propose scheduling a follow-up meeting early next week to go over the feedback and plan our roadmap for subsequent releases. I can coordinate a time that works for everyone. 

Thank you for your continued support and guidance.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
