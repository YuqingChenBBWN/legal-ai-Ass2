Subject: Upcoming Strategy Meeting

Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming strategy meeting scheduled for next week, I wanted to gather some insights on our ongoing projects and any milestones we should highlight.

One area that I believe stands out is our recent collaboration with Paywise. Their engagement has provided valuable feedback that could enhance our product positioning in the market. I think it would be beneficial to discuss how we can leverage this relationship further in our discussions during the meeting.

Please let me know if you have any specific points you would like to cover or if there are additional agenda items you think we should include.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
