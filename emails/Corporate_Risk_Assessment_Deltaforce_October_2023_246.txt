Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to bring to your attention a recent assessment our team conducted regarding our corporate risk exposure associated with Deltaforce, one of our five major clients. 

As you are aware, Deltaforce operates in a highly competitive sector, and there have been some concerning reports in the industry regarding potential financial instability within their operations. This raises a few risks for us, including:

1. **Revenue Dependency:** Canvassian currently relies significantly on Deltaforce for a substantial portion of our revenue. Any downturn in their business could impact our financial health.
  
2. **Contractual Obligations:** Our existing agreement with Deltaforce includes performance metrics that may be challenging for them to meet if they face operational issues. It may be prudent for us to consider revising our agreements to include protective clauses.

3. **Reputational Risk:** Should Deltaforce encounter serious financial difficulties, our association with them may affect our brand reputation and client trust.

Given these factors, I recommend that we schedule a meeting with the finance team to evaluate our exposure and explore possible contingencies, should the situation with Deltaforce evolve negatively. 

Please let me know when you would be available for further discussion.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
