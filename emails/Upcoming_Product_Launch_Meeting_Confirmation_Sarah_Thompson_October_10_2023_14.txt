Dear Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to confirm our upcoming meeting scheduled for Friday, October 15, 2023, at 10 AM in the main conference room. 

The agenda will focus on the strategies for our new product launch, including target markets, marketing approach, and timelines. Please prepare any insights you have regarding our existing client expectations, particularly from Paywise and Bravocat, as their feedback will be crucial in shaping our launch strategy.

Additionally, if you could bring along any data or reports that illuminate our current sales performance, that would be greatly appreciated. 

Looking forward to your contributions and our discussions.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
