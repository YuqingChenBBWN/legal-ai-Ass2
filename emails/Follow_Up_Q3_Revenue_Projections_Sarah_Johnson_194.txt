Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. 

I wanted to follow up on our previous discussions regarding the Q3 revenue projections for Canvassian. The initial analysis indicates a projected growth of 15%, primarily driven by our ongoing projects with Paywise and Alphabear. However, I recommend a deeper dive into the minor client performance to ensure we have a full understanding of any potential impacts on overall revenue.

Could we schedule a meeting next week to review these findings in detail? Additionally, I would like to gather input from the sales team regarding their forecasts and any obstacles they foresee in the coming quarter.

Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
