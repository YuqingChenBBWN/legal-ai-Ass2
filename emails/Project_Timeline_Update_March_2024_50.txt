Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well! I would like to take a moment to provide an important update regarding our current project timelines.

After our recent review meeting, we have identified key milestones and deadlines that will require our collective focus and effort. As such, Iâ€™d like to remind everyone of the following:

1. **Completion of Phase 1:** All teams must ensure that the deliverables for Phase 1 are submitted by the end of next week, specifically by Friday, March 15th. This includes all documentation and prototypes.

2. **Phase 2 Kick-off Meeting:** We will host a project kick-off meeting for Phase 2 on Monday, March 18th at 10:00 AM. Please make sure to prepare any insights or updates from your teams to discuss.

3. **Weekly Check-ins:** Starting next week, we will hold brief check-in meetings every Wednesday at 2:00 PM. This is an opportunity for all team leads to give updates on progress and address any concerns.

Let's continue to collaborate effectively and maintain our momentum. Your hard work and dedication are greatly appreciated and will lead us to success.

Should you have any questions or require further details, please feel free to reach out.
