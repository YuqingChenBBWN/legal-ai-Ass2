Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your immediate attention some concerning information regarding one of our major clients, Paywise.

Our latest assessments and communications with their finance team indicate that they are currently facing significant financial difficulties. They have mentioned potential cash flow issues and have expressed concerns about meeting their upcoming payment obligations. This situation is compounded by their recent restructuring initiatives, which have led to changes in key personnel and operational delays.

Given the potential implications for our revenue and relationship with Paywise, I recommend we arrange a strategic meeting to discuss our approach. It may be wise to explore how we can assist them during this challenging time while also safeguarding our interests.

Please let me know when you are available for a meeting, and I will coordinate with Edon and Michael to gather more data and insights.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
