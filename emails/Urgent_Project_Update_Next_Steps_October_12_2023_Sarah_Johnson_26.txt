Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to provide you with an urgent update on the development of our new software platform and outline the next steps that we need to take in order to ensure we remain on track.

1. **Current Status:**  
   Our software development team has completed the initial alpha version of the platform ahead of schedule. The user interface has been refined based on feedback from the beta testing group. 

2. **Testing Phase:**  
   We aim to start the formal testing phase next week. I suggest scheduling a meeting on October 18th to discuss the feedback we gathered from the initial testers and decide on any additional changes before shifting into beta testing.

3. **Resource Allocation:**  
   Given the rapid pace of development, we may need to allocate more resources, especially in QA. I recommend we review budgets during our next finance meeting.

4. **Client Engagement:**  
   I have reached out to our major clients (Paywise and Alphabear) to inform them about the upcoming changes and to gather their feedback. Their insights will be essential as we fine-tune the platform.

Please let me know if you would like me to prepare any additional materials for our meeting or if there is anyone else you suggest I include in this discussion.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,  
Sarah Johnson
