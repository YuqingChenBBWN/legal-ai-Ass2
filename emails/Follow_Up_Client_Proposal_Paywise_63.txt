Subject: Follow-Up on Client Proposal

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to take a moment to follow up on the proposal we submitted to Paywise last week. I believe it is critical that we remain proactive in our communications, as they are a key client for us.

Can we schedule a meeting later this week to discuss any feedback we've received and outline the next steps? Additionally, it would be great if we could compile any resources that would assist us during our discussion.

Please let me know your available times, and I'll coordinate accordingly.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication.

Best regards,
