Dear Edon,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the end of this quarter, I'd like to propose a strategy meeting to align our goals and initiatives for the upcoming quarter. It would be beneficial for us to discuss the progress on our current projects, as well as the necessary adjustments we need to make based on client feedback and market trends.

I suggest we cover the following topics during our meeting:

1. Review of product performance against our quarterly KPIs
2. Updates from the development team on ongoing projects
3. Insights from the sales team regarding client needs and expectations
4. Strategies for enhancing customer engagement and retention

Please let me know your availability next week, and I can coordinate with Emily to finalize a suitable time for everyone.  

Looking forward to our discussion.

Best regards,

Sophie Kim
