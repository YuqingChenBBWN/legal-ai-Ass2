Dear Ethan,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the end of the month, I wanted to touch base regarding the sales performance for March. I believe it’s crucial for our team to analyze our metrics in comparison to our projections, particularly given our recent push for new client acquisitions.

Could you please prepare a detailed report on our sales figures thus far? I’d like to include a breakdown of performance by client, focusing specifically on our major accounts: Paywise, Alphabear, Bravocat, Charlemont, Deltaforce, and Echona. It's essential we understand how each client is contributing to our overall growth.

Additionally, please highlight any trends you’ve observed and any challenges that the team may be facing. Your insights will be valuable as we formulate our strategies for the upcoming quarter.

Let’s aim to have this report ready by Friday afternoon so we can discuss it during our weekly meeting.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
