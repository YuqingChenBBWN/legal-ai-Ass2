Dear Alex,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an important matter regarding our client Charlemont that I believe requires immediate review from the risk management perspective.

Recently, we have observed some unusual trends in Charlemont’s purchasing behavior, which may imply potential financial instability. As a significant client of Canvassian, it's critical that we thoroughly assess any risks that might affect our ongoing relationship with them, and ultimately, our bottom line.

In particular, I would like to discuss the following points for our next risk management meeting:

1. Monitoring Charlemont’s financial statements for any signs of decreasing revenue or profit margins.
2. Analyzing the impact of potential layoffs within their organization that may affect our contracts and revenue streams.
3. Reviewing our contractual obligations and ensuring that we have proper safeguards in place should Charlemont's situation worsen.

I would appreciate your insights and any additional data you may have regarding Charlemont’s current status. Let’s prioritize this for our upcoming team catch-up.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,

Emily Chen
