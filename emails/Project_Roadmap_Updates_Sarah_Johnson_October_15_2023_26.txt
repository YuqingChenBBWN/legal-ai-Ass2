Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well!

I wanted to touch base regarding the upcoming project milestones we discussed in our last meeting. The team is making great progress, and we're on track to meet our deadlines. 

Additionally, I spoke with the client Paywise last week, and they expressed satisfaction with the current development phase. Their feedback was quite encouraging and will help us refine our deliverables further.

Letâ€™s plan a time to review the project roadmap and discuss any adjustments that may be necessary to ensure we keep our momentum.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,
