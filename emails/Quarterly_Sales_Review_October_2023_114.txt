Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the end of the quarter, I wanted to touch base regarding our sales figures for this period. Jane has expressed her enthusiasm about our progress, and I think it would be great to get the team together to review our current standings and strategize for the upcoming quarter.

Could you please gather the relevant data and prepare a summary for our meeting next week? I believe having a solid overview will help us present our achievements effectively and align our goals with Janeâ€™s vision moving forward.

Let me know if you need any assistance with the data compilation.

Best regards,  
Tom Harrison
