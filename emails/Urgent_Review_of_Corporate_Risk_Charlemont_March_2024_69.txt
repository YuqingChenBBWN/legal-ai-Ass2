Dear Robert,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention a significant corporate risk that we need to evaluate concerning our client, Charlemont. As you are aware, they have recently undergone a major restructuring, which might impact our ongoing projects and relationship.

There are two primary concerns we should address:

1. **Potential Delays in Deliverables:** With the restructuring in progress, thereâ€™s a possibility that Charlemont may face project delays, especially regarding their integration of our software solutions. This could lead to dissatisfaction and impact our reputation with them as a key client.

2. **Financial Stability:** Given the changes they are experiencing, we need to assess the impact of their financial health on our contracts. If they are unable to secure new funding promptly, it may jeopardize our current engagements and payment schedules.

I recommend that we schedule a strategy meeting with the relevant stakeholders, including the sales and product management teams, to discuss how we can mitigate these risks and ensure we continue to provide value to Charlemont during this transitional phase.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting next week.

Best regards,

Sarah Mitchell
