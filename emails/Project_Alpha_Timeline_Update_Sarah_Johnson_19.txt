Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the timeline for Project Alpha following our last meeting with the client, Paywise.

After discussing our developmental roadblocks and strategizing potential solutions, the team has concluded that we can push the launch date to the last week of next month. This will grant us additional time to enhance the features and conduct thorough testing to ensure the best possible outcome.

Please let me know if you foresee any potential issues or if there's anything specific you would like the team to address moving forward. I appreciate your leadership on this project and look forward to our continued collaboration.

Thanks,  
Sarah
