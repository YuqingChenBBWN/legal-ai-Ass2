Dear Liam,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent meeting with Paywise regarding their upcoming project with Canvassian. 

It seems that they have specific needs related to their integration timeline and have requested a more detailed proposal, which we need to finalize by the end of this week. I believe it would be beneficial for us to schedule a team meeting to discuss this so we can align our efforts and address any concerns they might have.

Please let me know your availability for a meeting, and I will coordinate with Jane and Edon as well.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

Sarah Mitchell
