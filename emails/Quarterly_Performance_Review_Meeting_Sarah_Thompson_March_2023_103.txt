Date: March 10, 2023  

Dear John,

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the end of the current quarter, I wanted to reach out to schedule our performance review meeting. It will be a great opportunity to discuss project progress, address any concerns, and explore further collaboration.

I also wanted to take a moment to highlight the positive feedback we've received from our clients, particularly Paywise, regarding the recent updates to our software. Their input has been invaluable in guiding our enhancements, and I'm excited to discuss how we can replicate this success in our future projects.

Please let me know your availability for next week so we can finalize a suitable time to meet.

Looking forward to your response!

Best regards,
