Dear Michael, 

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to take a moment to provide an update on our recent discussions about enhancing our client engagement strategies, particularly with our major clients like Paywise, Alphabear, and Bravocat. It's crucial that we adapt our services to better cater to their evolving needs and strengthen our partnerships.

I propose that we set up a meeting next week to brainstorm potential initiatives and review our existing client touchpoints. It would be beneficial to include input from the sales and product management teams, ensuring we cover all angles.

Could you check your calendar for Tuesday or Wednesday and let me know your availability? Also, if you think of anyone else who should join this meeting, please feel free to suggest.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
