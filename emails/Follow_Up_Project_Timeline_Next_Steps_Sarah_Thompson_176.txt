Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to follow up regarding our recent discussion about the timeline for the ongoing integration project between Canvassian and Paywise. As we progress, itâ€™s essential that we stay aligned on our goals and responsibilities to ensure a smooth execution.

Could you please provide an update on the latest feedback from your team? This will help us in finalizing the upcoming phases of the project.

Additionally, let's arrange a meeting next week to address any concerns and confirm our next steps. I am available Tuesday and Thursday afternoons; please let me know what works best for you.

Thank you for your collaboration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
