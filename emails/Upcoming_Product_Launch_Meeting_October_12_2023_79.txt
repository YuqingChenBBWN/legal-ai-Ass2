Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to remind everyone about the upcoming meeting scheduled for Thursday, the 12th of October at 10:00 AM in the main conference room. The focus of our discussion will be the launch of our new product, which is set to roll out next month. 

As we move closer to the launch date, it is crucial that all departments are aligned on their deliverables and timelines. Please ensure that you come prepared with updates on your respective tasks and any challenges you might be facing.

In addition, we'll have a Q&A session towards the end of the meeting. If you have any specific questions you'd like addressed, feel free to send them to me in advance.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication. Letâ€™s make this launch a great success!

Best Regards,

Sarah Mitchell
