Hi Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well!

I wanted to share a brief update regarding our ongoing projects. The team has made significant progress on the upcoming software release, and Iâ€™m confident that we will meet our deadlines.

Additionally, I had a productive meeting with Charlemont last week. They expressed their satisfaction with our service and discussed potential features that may enhance their experience further. I believe this could present an excellent opportunity for us to strengthen our partnership with them.

Looking forward to discussing this in more detail at our next team meeting.

Best,  
Liam Smith
