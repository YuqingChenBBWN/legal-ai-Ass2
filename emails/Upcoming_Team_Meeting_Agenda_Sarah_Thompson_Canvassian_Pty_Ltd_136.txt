Hi Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach our next team meeting scheduled for Thursday at 10 AM, I wanted to share the agenda items we will be discussing.

2. Review of client feedback and upcoming deliverables
3. A special note from Jane Wu regarding our vision for the next quarter
4. Open discussion on any immediate concerns or ideas for improvement

Please ensure that you come prepared with your updates so we can have a productive meeting. If there are any additional topics you feel need to be addressed, feel free to let me know by tomorrow afternoon.
