Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

As we prepare for our upcoming strategy meeting scheduled for next Thursday, October 12, at 10 AM AEST, we would like to gather your input on agenda items that you believe are important for discussion. This meeting will be a valuable opportunity for us to align our goals and strategies moving forward, particularly in relation to our current projects and client relationships.

Please send your suggestions by the end of this week, so we can compile a comprehensive agenda that addresses everyone's concerns and objectives.

Thank you for your contributions!

Best regards,

Sarah Brown
