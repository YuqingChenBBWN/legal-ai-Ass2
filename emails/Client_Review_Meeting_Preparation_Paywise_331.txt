Dear Sarah,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for our upcoming client review meeting next week, I wanted to share some preliminary notes and suggestions based on our last interactions with Paywise.

Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to align our presentation with some of the strategic goals set out by Jane during the recent strategy meeting. Her insights on client relations have always guided us well, and I believe emphasizing our commitment to customer satisfaction will resonate with Paywise.

Let me know when you would be available for a quick chat to go over our material and ensure we are all on the same page.

Best regards,

Daniel Stevens
