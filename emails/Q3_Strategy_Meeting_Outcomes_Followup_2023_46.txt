Subject: Review of Q3 Strategy Meeting Outcomes

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to follow up on our recent Q3 strategy meeting held on June 15, 2023. It was great to see everyoneâ€™s input and enthusiasm regarding our upcoming goals.

As discussed, the main focus areas moving forward include:

1. Enhancing our product offerings to meet the evolving needs of our clients, particularly Paywise and Bravocat.
2. Increasing our market presence in the Australian sector through targeted marketing campaigns.
3. Streamlining our internal processes to improve efficiency and reduce operational costs.

Please ensure that your respective teams are aligned with these objectives. I would like each department to provide a brief update on their action plans by the end of this month.

If you have any questions or need additional information, feel free to reach out. I'm looking forward to seeing Canvassian continue to thrive under our collective efforts.

Best regards,

Michael Johnson
