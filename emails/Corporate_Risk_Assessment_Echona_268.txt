Dear James,

I hope this message finds you well. 

As we prepare for the upcoming board meeting, I wanted to bring to your attention a corporate risk we need to consider regarding our client, Echona. Recently, they have been experiencing some shifts in leadership that could potentially affect our ongoing partnership. There have been speculations that they may be undergoing a significant restructuring, which might lead to delays in project deliveries.

Additionally, we need to assess their current financial health, as there are rumors of cash flow issues that could impact their ability to honor our existing contracts. I suggest we schedule a meeting to discuss an appropriate risk mitigation strategy should we need to address any unforeseen challenges that arise.

I'd like to propose getting insights from the finance team and perhaps gathering some market intelligence regarding Echona’s current standing. It would also be prudent to prepare a contingency plan should we face any interruptions in our collaboration with them.

Please let me know your thoughts, and if it’s convenient, I can draft a detailed risk assessment for our discussion next week.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
