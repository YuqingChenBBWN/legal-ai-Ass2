Hi Michael,  

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up regarding the latest developments on our software project for Paywise. The team has made significant progress, and I believe we are on track to meet the upcoming deadline.  

Could you please provide the latest feedback from their side? It would be helpful to ensure we are aligned with their expectations and to address any concerns they may have.  

Additionally, let's set a time to discuss our strategy for the next client outreach session, particularly focusing on how we can leverage our success with Paywise to attract more clients in the fintech space.  

Looking forward to your thoughts!  

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
