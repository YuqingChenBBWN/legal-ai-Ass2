Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well!

I wanted to provide a quick update on the current projects we have in the pipeline. The development team has made great progress on the new features planned for our upcoming release. As you know, we’ve been in close communication with our clients to ensure their needs are met, particularly with Paywise, who has expressed positive feedback on our recent enhancements.

It would be great if we could set up a time next week for a deeper dive into the project timeline and discuss any outstanding items. Please let me know your availability, and I’ll coordinate with the other team members.

Looking forward to catching up!

Best,  
Sarah Thompson
