Dear David,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to bring to your attention some insights regarding our ongoing relationship with our client, Echona. During our recent review, we identified certain corporate risks that could potentially impact our service delivery and, ultimately, our contractual obligations.

Echona has been experiencing some financial instability recently, which could lead to delays in payments or changes in their project scope. It's crucial that we adapt our risk management strategies accordingly, ensuring both our operations and our client relationship remain strong.

I propose we set up a meeting to discuss the potential implications and outline our mitigation strategies. This way, we can be proactive in our approach and safeguard our business interests while supporting Echona through these challenges.

Please let me know your availability for this discussion.

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
