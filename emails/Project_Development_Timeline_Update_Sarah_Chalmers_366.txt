Dear Edon,

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to provide you with an update on the project development timeline for our upcoming software release scheduled for Q4. The product management team, along with the software engineering team, has been making great strides in the development phase and is currently on track to meet our deadlines.

As of today, we have completed the initial testing and are addressing some of the feedback received during our recent reviews. Our next sprint will focus on optimizing performance and ensuring stability across all platforms.

Please let me know if there are any particular areas or concerns youâ€™d like to discuss further. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to set up a meeting next week to go over our progress and align on our go-to-market strategy.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,

Sarah Chalmers
