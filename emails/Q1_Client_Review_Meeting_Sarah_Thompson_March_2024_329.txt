Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well! As we prepare for our upcoming Q1 client review meeting scheduled for next week, I wanted to touch base regarding the agenda items. 

I think it would be beneficial to include updates on Charlemont's ongoing projects, especially since they have shown significant interest in expanding their collaboration with us. It would be great to gather insights from the product teams to address any specific feedback they might have.

Additionally, letâ€™s ensure we have metrics ready to discuss our overall performance with them and the other key clients.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best,  
Sarah Thompson
