Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well. 

I wanted to provide you with a quick update on the Q4 projects. Our team is making excellent progress on the new software features, and we anticipate having a beta release ready for testing by the end of the month. 

Additionally, I’ve had a chance to meet with our client Paywise to discuss their upcoming requirements. They are quite excited about the enhancements we’re working on, and I believe it will certainly strengthen our relationship with them. 

If you have any questions or need further information, feel free to reach out.

Best,  
Sarah Thompson
