Dear Team Leads,

I hope this message finds you well. As we are nearing the launch date for our new product, I would like to schedule a strategy meeting to discuss our approach and outline our responsibilities in the lead-up to the launch.

Please come prepared with updates from your respective teams, including marketing strategies, demo schedules, and potential challenges you foresee. This will be an essential meeting to ensure alignment across all departments and to maximize our impact during the launch.

Proposed meeting times are as follows:
- Tuesday, March 14, 2023, at 10:00 AM
- Wednesday, March 15, 2023, at 2:00 PM
- Thursday, March 16, 2023, at 1:00 PM

Please respond with your availability, and I will send a calendar invite to solidify the chosen time.

Thank you for your continued hard work and collaboration.
