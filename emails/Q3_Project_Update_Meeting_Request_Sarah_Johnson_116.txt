**Email Body:**

Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. As we are approaching the end of Q3, I wanted to schedule a meeting to discuss the updates on the current projects and ensure we are on track with our timelines and deliverables.

Please let me know your availability for next week. I believe it would be beneficial to include the product management team so they can provide their insights on the recent developments.

In addition, I would appreciate it if you could prepare an overview of the challenges we've encountered so far and any support that might be needed from senior management to overcome them.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Sarah Johnson
