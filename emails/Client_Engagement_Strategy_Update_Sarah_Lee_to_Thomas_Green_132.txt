**Subject:** Update on Client Engagement Strategy  

Dear Thomas,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to provide you with a brief update regarding our ongoing efforts to enhance our client engagement strategy. The feedback from both our major clients, such as Paywise and Alphabear, as well as some of our minor clients, has been overwhelmingly positive. 

We plan to schedule a meeting next week to discuss the implementation of new communication protocols aimed at improving our responsiveness and the overall client experience. Your insights regarding product updates will be invaluable during this discussion.

Please let me know your availability for a brief meeting on Wednesday or Thursday next week.

Thank you for your continued dedication to our clients.

Best regards,

Sarah Lee
