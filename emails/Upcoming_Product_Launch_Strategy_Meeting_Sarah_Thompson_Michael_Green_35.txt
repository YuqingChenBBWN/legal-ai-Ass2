**Dear Michael,**

I hope this email finds you well.

As we approach the launch of our new software platform next month, I would like to schedule a strategy meeting to discuss our marketing initiatives and how they can align effectively with your sales team’s goals. It’s vital that we ensure a coordinated effort to maximize our outreach and engagement with our current and potential clients.

Could you please let me know your availability for next week? I suggest we also include Edon and some of the product managers to provide insights on features and any technical queries that may arise during this phase.

Thank you for your cooperation. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,  
Sarah Thompson
