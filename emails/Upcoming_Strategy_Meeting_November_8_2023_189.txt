Subject: Upcoming Strategy Meeting

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to drive innovation and growth at Canvassian, I would like to invite you to attend an upcoming strategy meeting scheduled for next Wednesday, November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM AEST. The meeting will take place in the main conference room at our headquarters.

During this session, we will discuss our progress towards the goals set in our last quarterly planning meeting. We will also explore new market opportunities and review our project timelines to ensure we remain on track for the upcoming quarter.

Please come prepared to share updates from your respective teams, including any challenges you may be facing and suggestions for improvement. Your insights will be invaluable as we shape our strategies moving forward.

If you are unable to attend, kindly inform me by the end of the week so we can arrange for you to contribute your updates in another way.

Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication to Canvassian. I look forward to seeing all of you there.

Best regards,

Michael Thompson
