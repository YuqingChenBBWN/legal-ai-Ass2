**Subject:** Follow-Up on Client Presentation  

Dear James,

I hope this message finds you well.

I wanted to follow up regarding the presentation we delivered to Paywise last week. Your insights were invaluable, and I'm keen to hear any feedback that you may have received from the client since then. Specifically, I am interested in knowing if they had any further questions or if they require any additional material to assist in their decision-making process.

Additionally, I believe it would be beneficial for us to arrange a debrief meeting next week to discuss our strategy moving forward, especially concerning the action items we identified during the presentation. Please let me know your availability so we can coordinate with Jane and Edon.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication!

Best regards,

Sarah Thompson
