Hi Michael,

I hope this message finds you well! I wanted to provide a quick update on our ongoing projects and the upcoming milestones we’re targeting.

As you know, we have made significant strides in our development timeline, particularly with the new features we are rolling out for our clients. I believe the integration work we’re doing for Alphabear is on track for completion by the end of this month, and I’m excited about the feedback we've been receiving from their initial trials.

Let’s catch up later this week to discuss our next steps and any potential challenges we might face in delivering on our commitments. Please let me know your availability.

Best,  
Sarah Johnson
