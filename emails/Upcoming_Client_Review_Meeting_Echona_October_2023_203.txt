Dear Alex,

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to maintain strong relationships with our key clients, I would like to schedule a review meeting with our major client, Echona.

Please check your availability for the following dates:

- October 18, 2023, at 2:00 PM
- October 20, 2023, at 10:00 AM
- October 23, 2023, at 1:00 PM

The primary agenda for this meeting will be to discuss their feedback on our latest software release and explore any new opportunities for collaboration.

Once we finalize a date, I will prepare an agenda and send out a calendar invite. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
