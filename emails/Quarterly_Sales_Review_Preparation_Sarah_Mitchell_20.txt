Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. As we prepare for the upcoming quarterly sales review meeting, I wanted to remind you to gather the latest figures from the sales team. It would also be great to include any insights from product development, especially considering Edon Mask's recent innovations in our software solutions.

Could you please have a draft ready by next Friday? We will need to present a strong strategy moving forward, so your input will be crucial.

Thanks for your hard work, and let me know if you need any assistance putting this together.

Best,  
Sarah Mitchell
