Hi Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for the second quarter of the year, I wanted to touch base regarding the updates to our sales strategy that we discussed in our last meeting.

As the landscape is shifting and our client demands are evolving, I believe it is imperative that we refine our approach. With the release of our new product features, we should consider targeting our existing major clients like Paywise and Bravocat more aggressively, as they have provided positive feedback and are looking for more comprehensive solutions.

Additionally, I suggest we also focus on leveraging our existing minor clients to gather insights and understand their needs better. This could help us in tailoring our offerings and potentially converting them into larger accounts.

Could we schedule a time next week to review the updated sales materials and discuss our outreach plan? Iâ€™d like to ensure we present a cohesive strategy to the rest of the team ahead of the upcoming board meeting.

Looking forward to your input!

Best regards,
